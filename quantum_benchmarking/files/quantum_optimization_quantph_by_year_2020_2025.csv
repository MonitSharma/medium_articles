Multi-Target Rydberg Gates via Spatial Blockade Engineering,"Samuel Stein, Chenxu Liu, Shuwen Kan, Eleanor Crane, Yufei Ding, Ying Mao, Alexander Shuckert, Ang Li",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15282v1,"Multi-target gates offer the potential to reduce gate depth in syndrome extraction for quantum error correction. Although neutral-atom quantum computers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that avoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to single-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\otimes N}) gates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control and have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages tailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the control and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we design smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up to 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom placement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path to implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly reducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction."
Improved Algorithms for Quantum MaxCut via Partially Entangled Matchings,"Anuj Apte, Eunou Lee, Kunal Marwaha, Ojas Parekh, James Sud",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15276v1,"We introduce a $0.611$-approximation algorithm for Quantum MaxCut and a $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809$-approximation algorithm for the EPR Hamiltonian of [arXiv:2209.02589]. A novel ingredient in both of these algorithms is to partially entangle pairs of qubits associated to edges in a matching, while preserving the direction of their single-qubit Bloch vectors. This allows us to interpolate between product states and matching-based states with a tunable parameter."
Realization of maximally-entangling two-qutrit gates using the Cross-Resonance scheme,"Yash Saxena, Sagnik Chatterjee, Tharrmashastha Sapv",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15265v1,"Three-level systems have natural advantages over their two-level counterparts in quantum information and computation. Although generally used for qubits, the existing superconducting transmon architecture can naturally be extended to three levels, which allows the exploration of the entire qutrit Hilbert space. Realizing a maximally entangling two-qutrit gate is necessary for universal quantum computation using three-level systems. Our work extends the state-of-the-art approach by providing a theoretical framework for realizing a high-fidelity two-qutrit generalized CR gate using the cross-resonance framework. Using our framework, we experimentally demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$\sqrt{X}$ gates through simulations on QISKIT dynamics, which in turn allow us to obtain a maximum extracted concurrence of $97.2\pm0.1\%$, thereby demonstrating that entanglement has been achieved on all three levels. Using the above gates, we also prepare a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $96.9\pm 0.1\%$."
Sunflowers and Ramsey problems for restricted intersections,"Barnabás Janzer, Zhihan Jin, Benny Sudakov, Kewen Wu",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15264v1,"Extremal problems on set systems with restricted intersections have been an important part of combinatorics in the last 70 year. In this paper, we study the following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\subseteq \{0,\dots,k-1\}$ and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not contain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size in $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on $m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum computing.   As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\""uredi's celebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system method. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on the uniformity in F\""uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with significantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is still strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method."
Broadband Fourier transform spectroscopy of quantum emitters photoluminescence with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution,"Issam Belgacem, Pasquale Cilibrizzi, Muhammad Junaid Arshad, Daniel White, Malte Kroj, Christiaan Bekker, Margherita Mazzera, Brian D. Gerardot, Angelo C. Frangeskou, Gavin W. Morley, Nguyen Tien Son, Jawad Ul-Hassan, Takeshi Ohshima, Hiroshi Abe, Lorenzo Vinco, Dario Polli, Giulio Cerullo, Cristian Bonato",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15258v1,"The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast timescales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales."
Quantum-enhanced second harmonic generation beyond the photon pairs regime,"Thomas Dickinson, Ivi Afxenti, Giedre Astrauskaite, Lennart Hirsch, Samuel Nerenberg, Ottavia Jedrkiewicz, Daniele Faccio, Caroline Müllenbroich, Alessandra Gatti, Matteo Clerici, Lucia Caspani",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15249v1,"Two-photon processes are crucial in applications like microscopy and microfabrication, but their low cross-section requires intense illumination and limits, e.g., the penetration depth in nonlinear microscopy. Entangled states have been proposed to enhance the efficiency of two-photon interactions and have shown effectiveness at low intensities. This quantum enhancement is generally believed to be lost at high intensities, for more than one photon per mode, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explored experimentally and theoretically two-photon processes driven by entangled photons at intensities beyond this threshold and compared the results with the classical case. We found that a quantum advantage can still be observed at nearly one order of magnitude higher intensities than previously assumed. Our findings show a potential path for exploiting quantum-enhanced two-photon processes in practical applications."
Rydberg Atoms in a Ladder Geometry: Quench Dynamics and Floquet Engineering,"Mainak Pal, Tista Banerjee",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15230v1,"In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as novel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to particle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct test of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics starting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the fate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\Omega$ and a detuning profile which is staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\Delta$. As the staggering strength $\Delta$ is tuned from $\Delta/\Omega=0\rightarrow\infty$, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i) quantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\Delta/\Omega \sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\Delta/\Omega \gg 1$) . Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of this model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact Floquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical features against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols, long-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the environment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the Rydberg excited state."
Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point,Aditya Banerjee,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203v1,"The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several ""fine-grained"" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems."
Quantum phase discrimination with applications to quantum search on graphs,"Guanzhong Li, Lvzhou Li, Jingquan Luo",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15194v1,"We study the phase discrimination problem, in which we want to decide whether the eigenphase $\theta\in(-\pi,\pi]$ of a given eigenstate $|\psi\rangle$ with eigenvalue $e^{i\theta}$ is zero or not, using applications of the unitary $U$ provided as a black box oracle.We propose a quantum algorithm named {\it quantum phase discrimination(QPD)} for this task, with optimal query complexity $\Theta(\frac{1}{\lambda}\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ to the oracle $U$, where $\lambda$ is the gap between zero and non-zero eigenphases and $\delta$ the allowed one-sided error. The quantum circuit is simple, consisting of only one ancillary qubit and a sequence of controlled-$U$ interleaved with single qubit $Y$ rotations, whose angles are given by a simple analytical formula. Quantum phase discrimination could become a fundamental subroutine in other quantum algorithms, as we present two applications to quantum search on graphs:   i) Spatial search on graphs. Inspired by the structure of QPD, we propose a new quantum walk model, and based on them we tackle the spatial search problem, obtaining a novel quantum search algorithm. For any graph with any number of marked vertices, the quantum algorithm that can find a marked vertex with probability $\Omega(1)$ in total evolution time $ O(\frac{1}{\lambda \sqrt{\varepsilon}})$ and query complexity $ O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$, where $\lambda$ is the gap between the zero and non-zero eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian and $\varepsilon$ is a lower bound on the proportion of marked vertices.   ii) Path-finding on graphs.} By using QPD, we reduce the query complexity of a path-finding algorithm proposed by Li and Zur [arxiv: 2311.07372] from $\tilde{O}(n^{11})$ to $\tilde{O}(n^8)$, in a welded-tree circuit graph with $\Theta(n2^n)$ vertices.   Besides these two applications, we argue that more quantum algorithms might benefit from QPD."
Method for simulating open-system dynamics using mid-circuit measurements on a quantum computer,"John P. T. Stenger, Gloria Bazargan, Nicholas T. Bronn, Daniel Gunlycke",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15187v1,"We present a method for simulating the dynamics of an open electronic system on a quantum computer. This approach entails mid-circuit measurements and resets to simulate the addition or removal of fermions from the system and provides a way to apply non-reversible operations to a quantum computer. Using this method, we simulate the dynamics of an open electronic system consisting of a fermionic chain positioned between two conductive leads on the $ibm\_torino$ quantum computer."
Multiple Quantum Many-Body Clustering Probed by Dynamical Decoupling,"Gerónimo Sequeiros, Claudia M. Sánchez, Lisandro Buljubasich, Ana K. Chattah, Horacio M. Pastawski, Rodolfo H. Acosta",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15183v1,"The manipulation of quantum information in large systems requires precise control of quantum systems that are out-of-equilibrium. As the size of the system increases, its fragility in response to external perturbations and intrinsic decoherence processes also increases. The degradation of the system response makes accurate measurements a challenging and time-consuming task. However, quantum information lifetime enhancement can be achieved by dynamical decoupling techniques (DD), where an external drive with a frequency much higher than the system's internal evolution renders signal acquisition with decay times greater than 1000-fold. In this study, we demonstrate that the system response during a prethermal period, subject to Floquet control, can be utilized to probe the multiple quantum evolution of dense and highly connected spin systems. This approach exhibits an enhanced sensitivity at a reduced experimental time. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio achieved enabled the use of numerical inversion strategies to model the evolution of the excited multiple quantum coherences, which describe the number of correlated spins within a cluster. We observed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the increase in the number of correlated spins with multiple quantum evolution is accompanied by an increase in the distribution of spin cluster sizes, which follows a quadratic law."
Geometric speed limit of state preparation and curved control spaces,"Maximilian Goll, Robert H. Jonsson",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15175v1,"The preparation of quantum many-body systems faces the difficulty that in a realistic scenario only few control parameters of the system may be accessible. In this context, an interesting connection between the energy fluctuations during state preparation and its geometric length as measured by the Fubini-Study metric was discussed in Bukov et al., ""Geometric Speed Limit of Accessible Many-Body State Preparation"", Phys. Rev. X 9, 011034 (2019). An inspiring conjecture was put forward lower bounding the energy fluctuations by the minimal geometric length of all accessible state preparation protocols. We here show that the conjecture holds if the accessible parameter space has no extrinsic curvature, when embedded into the space of all dynamically accessible states. If the parameter space has extrinsic curvature a weakened version of the conjecture applies. We discuss instructive examples for a qubit system and harmonic oscillators."
Quantum Excitation Transfer in an Artificial Photosynthetic Light-Harvesting System,"Stephon Alexander, Roger Andrews, Oliver Fox, Sarben Sarkar",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15172v1,"We analytically derive transfer probabilities and efficiencies for an artificial light-harvesting photosynthetic system, which consists of a ring coupled to a central acceptor. For an incident photon pair, we find near-perfect single excitation transfer efficiency with negligible double excitation transfer in the weak coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, single excitation transfer efficiency was greater than 90%, while the double excitation efficiency was approximately 50%. We have found that the three main factors which determine high transfer efficiencies are large acceptor probabilities, long acceptor decay times, and strong photon-ring coupling. A possible implementation of the theoretical framework to bio-inspired solar energy devices is also discussed."
Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators,"Daichi Nakamura, Kohei Kawabata",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15154v1,"Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands."
Breaking Down Quantum Compilation: Profiling and Identifying Costly Passes,"Felix Zilk, Alessandro Tundo, Vincenzo De Maio, Ivona Brandic",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15141v1,"With the increasing capabilities of quantum systems, the efficient, practical execution of quantum programs is becoming more critical. Each execution includes compilation time, which accounts for substantial overhead of the overall program runtime. To address this challenge, proposals that leverage precompilation techniques have emerged, whereby entire circuits or select components are precompiled to mitigate the compilation time spent during execution. Considering the impact of compilation time on quantum program execution, identifying the contribution of each individual compilation task to the execution time is necessary in directing the community's research efforts towards the development of an efficient compilation and execution pipeline. In this work, we perform a preliminary analysis of the quantum circuit compilation process in Qiskit, examining the cumulative runtime of each individual compilation task and identifying the tasks that most strongly impact the overall compilation time. Our results indicate that, as the desired level of optimization increases, circuit optimization and gate synthesis passes become the dominant tasks in compiling a Quantum Fourier Transform, with individual passes consuming up to 87% of the total compilation time. Mapping passes require the most compilation time for a GHZ state preparation circuit, accounting for over 99% of total compilation time."
Fully connected twin-field quantum key distribution network,"Chunfeng Huang, Rui Guan, Xin Liu, Shizhuo Li, Wenjie He, Hao Liang, Ziyang Luo, Zhenrong Zhang, Wei Li, Kejin Wei",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15137v1,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key application in quantum communication, enabling secure key exchange between parties using quantum states. Twin-field (TF) QKD offers a promising solution that surpasses the repeaterless limits, and its measurement-device-independent nature makes it suitable for star-type network architectures. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fully connected TF-QKD network architecture, where users prepare quantum signals and send them to network nodes. These nodes use splitters to route the signals to measurement units, enabling secure key distribution among arbitrary users. A proof-of-principle demonstration with three users successfully achieved secure key sharing over simulated link losses of up to 30 dB, with an average rate of $5.01 \times 10^{-7}$ bit per pulse. Additionally, simulations show that the architecture can support up to $32$ users with a secure key rate of 280.90 bits/s under typical fiber loss conditions. This approach represents a significant advancement in the topology of untrusted-node QKD networks and holds promise for practical, large-scale applications in secure communication."
Efficient simulation of Clifford circuits with small Markovian errors,"Ashe Miller, Corey Ostrove, Jordan Hines, Robin Blume-Kohout, Kevin Young, Timothy Proctor",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15128v1,"Classical simulation of noisy quantum circuits is essential for understanding quantum computing experiments. It enables scalable error characterization, analysis of how noise impacts quantum algorithms, and optimized implementations of quantum error correction. However, most existing efficient simulation techniques can only simulate the effects of stochastic (incoherent) noise. The lack of efficient ways to simulate coherent errors, which are common and significant in contemporary quantum computing systems, has frustrated research. We remedy this gap by introducing an efficient algorithm for approximate simulation of Clifford circuits with arbitrary small errors (including coherent errors) that can be described by sparse $n$-qubit Lindbladians. We use this algorithm to study the impact of coherent errors on syndrome extract circuits for distance-3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 rotated surface codes, and on deep random 225-qubit circuits containing over a million gates."
Squeezing Effect in the Gouy Phase of Matter Waves,"Thiago M. S. Oliveira, Lucas S. Marinho, F. C. V. de Brito, Marcos Sampaio, Irismar G. da Paz",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15123v1,"We investigate the Gouy phase emerging from the time evolution of confined matter waves in a harmonic potential. Specifically, we analyze the quantum dynamics of a Gaussian wavepacket that exhibits position--momentum correlations. By tuning the parameters governing its evolution, we reveal intriguing effects, with a particular focus on squeezing. Notably, during the wavepacket evolution quantum spreading and squeezing processes emerge, giving rise to Gouy phase contributions of $\pi/4$ rad, establishing a clear link between the Gouy phase and a purely quantum phenomenon. Furthermore, the interplay between wavepacket squeezing and one-dimensional spreading leads to a total Gouy phase accumulation of $\pi/2$ rad in an oscillation period. Both squeezing and Gouy phase have individually proven valuable in state engineering and quantum metrology. By demonstrating a direct, controllable relationship between these two fundamental processes, our findings expand the realm of quantum-enhanced technologies, including quantum sensing and precision measurement."
Sensing with Quantum Light: A perspective,Animesh Datta,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15114v1,"I present my perspective on sensing with quantum light. I summarise the motivations and methodology for identifying quantum enhancements in sensing over a classical sensor. In the real world, this enhancement will be a constant factor, and not increase with the size of the quantum probe as is often advertised. I use a limited survey of interferometry, microscopy, and spectroscopy to extract the vital challenges that must be faced to realise tangible enhancements in sensing with quantum light."
Wireless energy transfer in non-Hermitian quantum battery,"Fang-Mei Yang, Fu-Quan Dou",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15091v1,"The extraction of energy is one of fundamental challenges in realizing quantum batteries (QBs). Here, we propose two wireless transfer schemes with parity-time symmetries to efficiently extract the energy stored in non-Hermitian QBs to consumption centers. For linear cases, the transfer energy oscillates periodically in the unbroken symmetry region and grows hyperbolically in the broken region. For nonlinear cases, the transfer energy eventually reach and remain steady-state values arising from the feedback mechanism of the nonlinear saturable gain. Furthermore, we show the significant robustness and the ultrafast response of the wireless transfer schemes to sudden movements around one metre. Our work overcomes energy bottlenecks for wireless transfer schemes in QBs and may provide inspirations for practical applications of QBs."
Automated discovery and optimization of autonomous quantum error correction codes for a general open quantum system,Sahel Ashhab,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15070v1,"We develop a method to search for the optimal code space, induced decay rates and control Hamiltonian to implement autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) for a general open quantum system. The system is defined by a free-evolution Lindbladian superoperator, which contains the free Hamiltonian and naturally occurring decoherence terms, as well as the control superoperators. The performance metric for optimization is the fidelity between the projector onto the code space and the same projector after Lindbladian evolution for a specified time. We use a gradient-based search to update the code words, induced decay matrix and control Hamiltonian matrix. We apply the method to optimize AQEC codes for a variety of few-level systems. The four-level system with uniform decay rates offers a simple example for testing and illustrating the operation of our approach. The algorithm reliably succeeds in finding the optimal code in this case, while success becomes probabilistic for more complicated cases. For a five-level system with photon loss decay, the algorithm finds good AQEC codes, but these codes are not as good as the well-known binomial code. We use the binomial code as a starting point to search for the optimal code for a perturbed five-level system. In this case, the algorithm finds a code that is better than both the original binomial code and any other code obtained numerically when starting from a random initial guess."
Failure of the comformal-map method for relativistic quantum billiards,Barbara Dietz,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15055v1,"We demonstrate that the conformal-map method introduced by Robnik in 1984 for nonrelativistic quantum billiards is not applicable for the quantization of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs) consisting of a massless non-interacting spin-1/2 particle confined to a two-dimensional domain. To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are corroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic quantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of the properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics."
Quantum pseudoresources imply cryptography,"Alex B. Grilo, Álvaro Yángüez",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15025v1,"While one-way functions (OWFs) serve as the minimal assumption for computational cryptography in the classical setting, in quantum cryptography, we have even weaker cryptographic assumptions such as pseudo-random states, and EFI pairs, among others. Moreover, the minimal assumption for computational quantum cryptography remains an open question. Recently, it has been shown that pseudoentanglement is necessary for the existence of quantum cryptography (Goul\~ao and Elkouss 2024), but no cryptographic construction has been built from it.   In this work, we study the cryptographic usefulness of quantum pseudoresources -- a pair of families of quantum states that exhibit a gap in their resource content yet remain computationally indistinguishable. We show that quantum pseudoresources imply a variant of EFI pairs, which we call EPFI pairs, and that these are equivalent to quantum commitments and thus EFI pairs. Our results suggest that, just as randomness is fundamental to classical cryptography, quantum resources may play a similarly crucial role in the quantum setting.   Finally, we focus on the specific case of entanglement, analyzing different definitions of pseudoentanglement and their implications for constructing EPFI pairs. Moreover, we propose a new cryptographic functionality that is intrinsically dependent on entanglement as a resource."
Trainable Quantum Neural Network for Multiclass Image Classification with the Power of Pre-trained Tree Tensor Networks,"Keisuke Murota, Takumi Kobori",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14995v1,"Tree tensor networks (TTNs) offer powerful models for image classification. While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification."
Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems,"Jithin T Surendran, Indrajeet D Prasad, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Santosh Kumar",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14986v1,"Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale."
Nonreciprocal photon blockade induced by parametric amplification in an asymmetrical cavity,"Shao-Xiong Wu, Xue-Chen Gao, Huan-Huan Cheng, Cheng-Hua Bai",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14974v1,"We propose a scheme to generate and manipulate nonreciprocal photon blockade effect in an asymmetrical Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity, which consists of a single two-level atom and a second-order nonlinear medium. By utilizing the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of cavity and applying a parametric amplification pumping laser to the nonlinear medium, we can realize direction-dependent single-photon and two-photon blockade effects. For nonreciprocal single-photon blockade, our proposal is robust across a wide range of parameters, such as the cavity or atomic detuning, coupling strength, and atomic decay. Within similar parameter ranges, nonreciprocal two-photon blockade can be achieved and modulated by finely adjusting the parametric amplification pumping. Our project offers a feasible access to generating high-quality and tunable nonreciprocal single/two-photon source and paves a new avenue for investigating the nonreciprocity of photon quantum statistical properties."
Advancing quantum process tomography through universal compilation,"Huynh Le Dan Linh, Vu Tuan Hai, Le Bin Ho",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14958v1,"Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for characterizing operations in quantum gates and circuits, however, existing methods face scalability and noise sensitivity challenges.

This method utilizes efficient algorithms to improve accuracy while reducing resource requirements. We benchmark our approach through numerical simulations of random unitary gates, demonstrating highly accurate quantum process characterization. Additionally, we apply it to dephasing processes with time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous noise, achieving improved fidelity and robustness. Our work further enables broader applications in quantum error correction and device validation."
Parallel Kac's Walk Generates PRU,"Chuhan Lu, Minglong Qin, Fang Song, Penghui Yao, Mingnan Zhao",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14957v1,"Ma and Huang recently proved that the PFC construction, introduced by Metger, Poremba, Sinha and Yuen [MPSY24], gives an adaptive-secure pseudorandom unitary family PRU.

In this work, we show that a linear number of sequential repetitions of the parallel Kac's Walk, introduced by Lu, Qin, Song, Yao and Zhao [LQSY+24], also forms an adaptive-secure PRU, confirming a conjecture therein. Moreover, it additionally satisfies strong security against adversaries making inverse queries. This gives an alternative PRU construction, and provides another instance demonstrating the power of the path recording technique. We also discuss some further simplifications and implications."
Solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in external Yang-Mills gauge field,V. V. Parazian,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14953v1,Exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in an external non-Abelian gauge field with an SU(N) symmetry group have been obtained. The external field is a solution of the Yang-Mills equations and describes a plane wave on the light cone. The obtained solutions form a complete set and can be used in the procedure of canonical quantization of scalar fields.
Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization,Stefano Longhi,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14910v1,"A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics."
Converting $PT$-Symmetric Topological Classes by Floquet Engineering,"Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14846v1,"Going beyond the conventional classification rule of Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, $PT$ symmetric topological phases are classified by $(PT)^2=1$ or $-1$. The interconversion between the two $PT$-symmetric topological classes is generally difficult due to the constraint of $(PT)^2$. Here, we propose a scheme to control and interconvert the $PT$-symmetric topological classes by Floquet engineering. We find that it is the breakdown of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge, induced by the $\pi$ phase difference between different hopping rates, by the periodic driving that leads to such an interconversion. Relaxing the system from the constraint of $(PT)^2$, rich exotic topological phases, e.g., the coexisting $PT$-symmetric first-order real Chern insulator and second-order topological insulators not only in different quasienergy gaps, but also in one single gap, are generated. In contrast to conventional Floquet topological phases, our result provides a way to realize exotic topological phases without changing symmetries. It enriches the family of topological phases and gives an insightful guidance for the development of multifunctional quantum devices."
(Sub)Exponential Quantum Speedup for Optimization,"Jiaqi Leng, Kewen Wu, Xiaodi Wu, Yufan Zheng",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14841v1,"We demonstrate provable (sub)exponential quantum speedups in both discrete and continuous optimization, achieved through simple and natural quantum optimization algorithms, namely the quantum adiabatic algorithm for discrete optimization and quantum Hamiltonian descent for continuous optimization. Our result builds on the Gily\'en--Hastings--Vazirani (sub)exponential oracle separation for adiabatic quantum computing. With a sequence of perturbative reductions, we compile their construction into two standalone objective functions, whose oracles can be directly leveraged by the plain adiabatic evolution and Schr\""odinger operator evolution for discrete and continuous optimization, respectively."
Variational quantum algorithm for the Poisson equation based on the banded Toeplitz systems,"Xiaoqi Liu, Yuedi Qu, Ming Li, Shu-qian Shen",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14828v1,"For solving the Poisson equation it is usually possible to discretize it into solving the corresponding linear system $Ax=b$.Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for the discreted Poisson equation have been studied before. We give a VQA based on the banded Toeplitz systems for solving the Poisson equation with respect to the structural features of matrix $A$. In detail, we decompose the matrix $A$ and $A^2$ into a linear combination of the corresponding banded Toeplitz matrix and sparse matrices with only a few non-zero elements. For the one-dimensional Poisson equation with different boundary conditions and the $d$-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the number of decomposition terms is less than the work in [Phys. Rev. A 108, 032418 (2023)]. Based on the decomposition of the matrix, we design quantum circuits that evaluate efficiently the cost function.Additionally, numerical simulation verifies the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. In the end, the VQAs for linear systems of equations and matrix-vector multiplications with $K$-banded Teoplitz matrix $T_n^K$ are given, where $T_n^K\in R^{n\times n}$ and $K\in O({\rm ploy}\log n)$."
Categorifying Clifford QCA,Bowen Yang,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14811v1,"We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework."
Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation,Xing M. Wang,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791v1,"The interpretation of quantum measurements presents a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics, with concepts such as the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), and Bohmian Mechanics (BM) offering distinct perspectives. We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI), which describes measurement as branching the local Hilbert space of a system into parallel subspaces. We formalize the mathematical framework of BHSI using branching and the engaging and disengaging unitary operators to relationally and causally update the states of observers. Unlike the MWI, BHSI avoids the ontological proliferation of worlds and copies of observers, realizing the Born rule based on branch weights. Unlike the CI, BHSI retains the essential features of the MWI: unitary evolution and no wavefunction collapse. Unlike the BM, BHSI does not depend on a nonlocal structure, which may conflict with relativity. We apply BHSI to examples such as the double-slit experiment, the Bell test, Wagner and his friend, and the black hole information paradox. In addition, we explore whether recohering branches can be achieved in BHSI. Compared to the CI and MWI, BHSI provides a minimalist, unitarity-preserving, collapse-free, and probabilistically inherent alternative interpretation of quantum measurements."
Geometric Learning Dynamics,Vitaly Vanchurin,2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14728v1,"We present a unified geometric framework for modeling learning dynamics in physical, biological, and machine learning systems. The theory reveals three fundamental regimes, each emerging from the power-law relationship $g \propto \kappa^a$ between the metric tensor $g$ in the space of trainable variables and the noise covariance matrix $\kappa$. The quantum regime corresponds to $a = 1$ and describes Schr\""odinger-like dynamics that emerges from a discrete shift symmetry. The efficient learning regime corresponds to $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and describes very fast machine learning algorithms. The equilibration regime corresponds to $a = 0$ and describes classical models of biological evolution. We argue that the emergence of the intermediate regime $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a key mechanism underlying the emergence of biological complexity."
Unconventional Chemical Bonding of Lanthanide-OH Molecules,"Jacek Kłos, Eite Tiesinga, Lan Cheng, Svetlana Kotochigova",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14698v1,"We present a theoretical study of the low lying adiabatic relativistic electronic states of lanthanide monohydroxide (Ln-OH) molecules near their linear equilibrium geometries. We focus on heavy, magnetic DyOH and ErOH relevant to fundamental symmetry tests. We use a restricted-active-space self-consistent field method combined with spin-orbit coupling as well as a relativistic coupled-cluster method. In addition, electric dipole and magnetic moments are computed with the self-consistent field method. Analysis of the results from both methods shows that the dominant molecular configuration of the ground state is one where an electron from the partially filled and submerged 4f orbital of the lanthanide atom moves to the hydroxyl group, leaving the closed outer-most 6s$^2$ lone electron pair of the lanthanide atom intact in sharp contrast to the bonding in alkaline-earth monohydroxides and YbOH, where an electron from the outer-most s shell moves to the hydroxyl group. For linear molecules the projection of the total electron angular momentum on the symmetry axis is a conserved quantity with quantum number $\Omega$ and we study the polynomial $\Omega$ dependence of the energies of the ground states as well as their electric and magnetic moments. We find that the lowest energy states have $|\Omega|=15/2$ and 1/2 for DyOH and ErOH, respectively. The zero field splittings among these $\Omega$ states is approximately $hc\times 1\,000$~cm$^{-1}$. We find that the permanent dipole moments for both triatomics are fairly small at 0.23 atomic units. The magnetic moments are closely related to that of the corresponding atomic Ln$^+$ ion in an excited electronic state. We also realize that the total electron angular momentum is to good approximation conserved and has a quantum number of 15/2 for both triatomic molecules."
Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates,"Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685v1,"This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects."
Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems,"Tamoghna Ray, Abhishek Dhar, Manas Kulkarni",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675v1,"We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics."
Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line,"Luca Giacomelli, Michel H. Devoret, Cristiano Ciuti",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14651v1,"We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions."

Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the overall performance when two arbitrary and asymmetric sources the MDI users employ. As a specific application, we calculate the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare this result to the cases with symmetric sources. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources. Since requiring all users to employ identical sources in a network is unreasonable, our theory paves the way for the practical deployment of MDI-QKD networks."

Using a transfer matrix approach, we develop a protocol for deterministic phase gate operation, demonstrating its robustness against non-waveguide mode coupling and disorder. Finally, we relax the idealized assumption of monochromatic light, considering finite-bandwidth pulses. Despite these realistic considerations, our results indicate high fidelity for the proposed phase gate protocol. Finally we will discuss two qubit operations."

Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality."
Quantum-Enhanced Weight Optimization for Neural Networks Using Grover's Algorithm,"Stefan-Alexandru Jura, Mihai Udrescu",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14568v1,"The main approach to hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (QNN) is employing quantum computing to build a neural network (NN) that has quantum features, which is then optimized classically. Here, we propose a different strategy: to use quantum computing in order to optimize the weights of a classical NN. As such, we design an instance of Grover's quantum search algorithm to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters of an NN during the training process, a task traditionally performed using the backpropagation algorithm with the gradient descent method. Indeed, gradient descent has issues such as exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, or convexity problem. Other methods tried to address such issues with strategies like genetic searches, but they carry additional problems like convergence consistency. Our original method avoids these issues -- because it does not calculate gradients -- and capitalizes on classical architectures' robustness and Grover's quadratic speedup in high-dimensional search spaces to significantly reduce test loss (58.75%) and improve test accuracy (35.25%), compared to classical NN weight optimization, on small datasets. Unlike most QNNs that are trained on small datasets only, our method is also scalable, as it allows the optimization of deep networks; for an NN with 3 hidden layers, trained on the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, we obtained a mean accuracy of 97.7%. Moreover, our method requires a much smaller number of qubits compared to other QNN approaches, making it very practical for near-future quantum computers that will still deliver a limited number of logical qubits."

However, their potential has not been fully unleashed for domain-specific programming languages, where specific domain exhibits unique optimization opportunities for customized improvement. In this paper, we take the first step in exploring multi-agent code generation for quantum programs. By identifying the unique optimizations in quantum designs such as quantum error correction, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework tailored to generating accurate, fault-tolerant quantum code. Each agent in the framework focuses on distinct optimizations, iteratively refining the code using a semantic analyzer with multi-pass inference, alongside an error correction code decoder. We also examine the effectiveness of inference-time techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of quantum programming, uncovering observations that are different from general-purpose code generation. To evaluate our approach, we develop a test suite to measure the impact each optimization has on the accuracy of the generated code. Our findings indicate that techniques such as structured CoT significantly improve the generation of quantum algorithms by up to 50%. In contrast, we have also found that certain techniques such as RAG show limited improvement, yielding an accuracy increase of only 4%. Moreover, we showcase examples of AI-assisted quantum error prediction and correction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-agent framework in reducing the quantum errors of generated quantum programs."

This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional ``level statistics"" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates.

One striking feature of optimal probing state in this task can be observed if we increase the number of unitaries more than two. There exists a class of unitaries in every dimension $\geqslant$ 3 for which an input entangled state cannot distinguish them but an input single state can."

Our method allows multiple quantum states to be observed at different points within a single circuit, one at a time, and saved into classical memory without destruction. These saved states can be accessed on demand by downstream applications, introducing a dynamic and programmable notion of quantum memory that supports modular, non-destructive quantum workflows. We propose a hardware-agnostic, machine learning-driven framework to capture non-destructive estimates, or ""snapshots,"" of quantum states at arbitrary points within a circuit, enabling classical storage and later reconstruction, similar to memory operations in classical computing. This capability is essential for debugging, introspection, and persistent memory in quantum systems, yet remains difficult due to the no-cloning theorem and destructive measurements. Our guess-and-check approach uses fidelity estimation via the SWAP test to guide state reconstruction. We explore both gradient-based deep neural networks and gradient-free evolutionary strategies to estimate quantum states using only fidelity as the learning signal. We demonstrate a key component of our framework on IBM quantum hardware, achieving high-fidelity (approximately 1.0) reconstructions for Hadamard and other known states. In simulation, our models achieve an average fidelity of 0.999 across 100 random quantum states.

Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach,"David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio, Norbert Schuch",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14380v1,"Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters."

While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos."
Application of an upsampling algorithm to quantum state preparation of continuous and discrete probability distributions,R. P.

The quantum circuit of preparation derived from functional data sampled in this way exhibits exponential gate depth, like other divide-and-conquer algorithms, but is transformable to an equivalent circuit of polylogarithmic gate depth. In this study, we derive a polylogarthmic upsampling algorithm for construction of a state vector with amplitudes that are square roots of probabilities sampled from a continuous probability distribution having support over the entire real line. As examples, we prepare state vectors associated with Gaussian and Laplace distributions; state vectors for other continuous probability distributions such as Cauchy and Student's t follow in a similar manner. We also extend the algorithm to include preparation of a state vector whose amplitudes are square roots of an arbitrary distribution of discrete probabilities. Our analyses focus on univariate distributions, but can be extended to multivariate forms. The polylogarithmic upsampling algorithm has financial and scientific application."
Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes,"Yevhenii Morozov, Anatoliy Lapchuk",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342v1,"Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation shows that for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 1^(-9) RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure."

This result solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture stating that a model is integrable only if this model has a 3-local conserved quantity. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation."

Teretenkov",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14312v1,"In this work, we model the temperature measurement as a transformation of the arbitrary state into the Gibbs state. We start with a general formalism of ansatz-posteriors, which includes many usual models of posterior states due to measurement or state preparation. On the one hand, it contains models of selective and non-selective measurements posteriors as special cases, which allows us to consider it as a generalization of usual measurement models. On the other hand, it contains the abovementioned transformation into the Gibbs state as a special case as well. We derive an analog of the master equation in the stroboscopic limit of repeated measurements. Then we apply our general approach to temperature measurement."
Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective,"Anneswa Paul, Upendra Harbola",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14266v1,"Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field."

Refinement orders for quantum programs,"Yuan Feng, Li Zhou",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14158v1,"Refinement is an influential technique used in the verification and development of computer programs. It provides a systematic and rigorous approach to software development through stepwise refinement, where a high-level abstract specification is progressively transformed into an implementation that meets the desired requirements. Central to this technique is the notion of a refinement order, which ensures that each refinement step preserves program correctness. Different orders can be defined with respect to partial and total correctness, as well as for deterministic and nondeterministic programs. In the realm of quantum programs, the theory becomes even more intricate due to the existence of various quantum state predicates, leading to different notions of specifications. This paper thoroughly explores different refinement orders for quantum programs and examines the relationships between them."
Breaking the Diffraction Barrier for Passive Sources: Parameter-Decoupled Superresolution Assisted by Physics-Informed Machine Learning,"Abdelali Sajia, Bilal Benzimoun, Pawan Khatiwada, Guogan Zhao, Xiao-Feng Qian",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14156v1,"We present a parameter-decoupled superresolution framework for estimating sub-wavelength separations of passive two-point sources without requiring prior knowledge or control of the source. Our theoretical foundation circumvents the need to estimate multiple challenging parameters such as partial coherence, brightness imbalance, random relative phase, and photon statistics. A physics-informed machine learning (ML) model (trained with a standard desktop workstation), synergistically integrating this theory, further addresses practical imperfections including background noise, photon loss, and centroid/orientation misalignment. The integrated parameter-decoupling superresolution method achieves resolution 14 and more times below the diffraction limit (corresponding to ~ 13.5 nm in optical microscopy) on experimentally generated realistic images with >82% fidelity, performance rivaling state-of-the-art techniques for actively controllable sources. Critically, our method's robustness against source parameter variability and source-independent noises enables potential applications in realistic scenarios where source control is infeasible, such as astrophysical imaging, live-cell microscopy, and quantum metrology. This work bridges a critical gap between theoretical superresolution limits and practical implementations for passive systems."
A streamlined demonstration that stabilizer circuits simulation reduces to Boolean linear algebra,Vsevolod I. Yashin,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14101v1,"Gottesman-Knill theorem states that computations on stabilizer circuits can be simulated on a classical computer, conventional simulation algorithms extensively use linear algebra over bit strings. For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations. This approach gives a new perspective on explaining the work of stabilizer tableau methods (reproducing the asymptotics) and creates opportunity for exploring various tensor-contraction techniques in stabilizer simulation."
Lyapunov Dynamics in Entangled Biphoton Spectroscopy,"Sameer Damball, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada, Eric R. Bittner",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14086v1,"Recent advances in quantum light spectroscopy highlight the potential of using entangled photons as a sensitive probe for many-body dynamics and material correlations. However, a comprehensive theory to explain experimental results remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the Hilbert space and the intricate interactions and nonlinearities inherent in material systems. In this work, we introduce a tractable model based on a finite-sized correlation matrix governed by a bilinear bosonic Hamiltonian, enabling efficient simulations through Gaussian-preserving dynamics. We apply this framework to compute the output joint spectral intensity (JSI) and von Neumann entropy of frequency-entangled biphotons, and find close agreement with experimental observations in empty microcavities. Our results reveal the emergence of off-diagonal spectral correlations that can be interpreted as irreversible decay of cavity excitations into the biphoton continua. This approach offers a powerful theoretical tool for interpreting quantum spectroscopic data and paves the way for probing more complex light-matter interactions in materials."
Ptychographic estimation of qudit states encoded in the angular position and orbital angular momentum of single photons,"A. M. da Costa, L. Neves",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14073v1,"Ptychography is a computational imaging technique mainly used in optical and electron microscopy. Its quantum analogue was recently introduced as a simple method for estimating unknown pure quantum states through projections onto partially overlapping subspaces, each one followed by a projective measurement in the Fourier basis. In the end, an iterative algorithm estimates the state from the collected data. Here, we theoretically describe how to implement this method for $D$-dimensional qudit states encoded in the angular position and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of single photons. For this purpose, we define the qudit by discretizing the spatial profile of a photon in cylindrical coordinates, using an array of $D$ angular slits symmetrically distributed in the transverse plane. To apply ptychography to this encoding, we show that the intermediate projections will be carried out by simple binary spatial filters in the angular paths, while the measurement in the Fourier basis will be performed by postselecting $D$ OAM modes compatible with the quantum Fourier transform of the path basis. We illustrate the effectiveness of this scheme through simulations and discuss its experimental feasibility."
Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach,"Van Sy Mai, Abderrahim Amlou, Amar Abane, Abdella Battou",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14040v1,"This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator."

To contextualize the techniques discussed here, demonstrative examples in two prototypical quantum systems, namely colloidal nanocrystals and vacancy centers in diamond, are provided."
Comparative Benchmarking of Utility-Scale Quantum Emulators,"Anna Leonteva, Guido Masella, Maxime Outteryck, Asier Piñeiro Orioli, Shannon Whitlock",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14027v1,"Evaluating quantum algorithms at utility-scale - involving more than 100 qubits - is a key step toward advancing real-world applications of quantum computing.

Performance is assessed on 13 benchmark circuits from the MQTBench library, spanning circuit sizes from 4 to 1,024 qubits. Our results reveal that MPS-based emulators outperform other approaches overall, successfully solving 8 benchmarks up to the maximum size of 1,024 qubits and 12 benchmarks up to at least 100 qubits in less than 5 minutes.

Short remarks on shallow unitary circuits,Jeongwan Haah,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14005v1,(i) We point out that every shallow unitary circuit of depth smaller than the linear system size is easily distinguished from a Haar random unitary if there is a conserved quantity that is a sum of local operators. This is always the case with a continuous onsite symmetry or with a local energy conservation law. (ii) We explain a simple algorithm for a formulation of the shallow unitary circuit learning problem and relate it to an open question on strictly locality-preserving unitaries (quantum cellular automata). (iii) We show that any quantum cellular automaton in $D$-dimensional lattice of volume~$V$ can be implemented using only $O(V)$ local gates in a staircase fashion.

Quantum Contextuality for Contextual Word Embeddings,Karl Svozil,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13824v1,"Conventional word-to-vector embeddings face challenges in representing polysemy, where word meaning is context-dependent. While dynamic embeddings address this, we propose an alternative framework utilizing quantum contextuality. In this approach, words are encoded as single, static vectors within a Hilbert space. Language contexts are formalized as maximal observables, mathematically equivalent to orthonormal bases. A word vector acquires its specific semantic meaning based on the basis (context) it occupies, leveraging the quantum concept of intertwining contexts where a single vector can belong to multiple, mutually complementary bases. This method allows meaning to be constructed through orthogonality relationships inherent in the contextual structure, potentially offering a novel way to statically encode contextual semantics."
Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation,"Siddhant Midha, Sarang Gopalakrishnan",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13815v1,"We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation."

The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures."

Here, the WR-PTP serves as a scalable network synchronization protocol, and its performance is compared to traditional methods of local synchronization. We demonstrate pulse-to-pulse synchronization better than 3 ps and time deviation (TDEV) values below 4 ps for all averaging times up to 10 s.

Furthermore, we develop a variational quantum eigensolver that allows for reliably preparing the ground state of the theory in both the absence and presence of static charges and to capture the static aspects of the phenomenon. Carrying out state preparation on real quantum hardware for up to 19 qubits, we demonstrate its suitability for current quantum devices. In addition, we study the real-time dynamics of a flux tube between two static charges using both Tensor Networks and quantum hardware. Using a trotterization for the time-evolution operator, we are able to show that the breaking process starts with the creation of charges inside the string. These eventually redistribute towards the static charges and screen them, which leads to the breaking of the flux tube."

We examine the time evolution of the concurrence of the eigenstates of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and show that, for both initially separable and initially entangled states, simple product measurements suffice to saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound when CoE = -QFI, while otherwise, in general, entangled measurements are required giving an operational significance to the points in time when CoE = -QFI."
The relativity of color perception,"Michel Berthier, Valerie Garcin, Nicoletta Prencipe, Edoardo Provenzi",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13720v1,"Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a visual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by neurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of photoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile trichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or experimental assumption."
Landscape of Quantum Information Science and Engineering Education: From Physics Foundations to Interdisciplinary Frontiers,"A. R. Piña, Shams El-Adawy, Mike Verostek, Brett T.

Although QISE education still has a strong presence and roots in physics, the field is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. There is a need to understand the presence of QISE instruction and quantum-related instruction across all disciplines in order to figure out where QISE education is already happening and where it could be expanded. Although there is recent work that characterizes introductory QISE courses, there is no holistic picture of the landscape of QISE and quantum-related education in the United States. We analyzed course catalogs from 1,456 U.S. institutions. We found 61 institutions offering QISE degree programs, mostly at PhD-granting schools, with physics, electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and computer science(CS) as their primary contributors . Across all institutions, we identified over 8,000 courses mentioning 'quantum,' but about one-third of institutions in our study had none. We also found over 500 dedicated QISE courses, concentrated in PhD-granting institutions, primarily in physics, ECE, and CS. Physics leads in offering both general quantum-related ($\sim$4,700) and QISE-specific ($\sim$200) courses. Across multiple disciplines, we see that QISE topics are being introduced in courses not fully dedicated to QISE, which may be a productive strategy for increasing access to QISE education. Our dataset and analysis provide the most comprehensive overview to date of quantum education across US higher education. To ensure broad access, all data are publicly available and downloadable at quantumlandscape.streamlit.app. We hope these findings will support and guide future efforts in curriculum design, workforce development, and education policy across the quantum ecosystem."
Fast microwave-driven two-qubit gates between fluxonium qubits with a transmon coupler,"Siddharth Singh, Eugene Y. Huang, Jinlun Hu, Figen Yilmaz, Martijn F. S.

Using superconducting circuits, two-qubit gates have previously been implemented in different ways with each method aiming to maximize gate fidelity. Another important goal of a new gate scheme is to minimize the complexity of gate calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a high-fidelity two-qubit gate between two fluxonium qubits enabled by an intermediate capacitively coupled transmon. The coupling strengths between the qubits and the coupler are designed to minimize residual crosstalk while still allowing for fast gate operations. The gate is based on frequency selectively exciting the coupler using a microwave drive to complete a 2$\pi$ rotation, conditional on the state of the fluxonium qubits. When successful, this drive scheme implements a conditional phase gate. Using analytically derived pulse shapes, we minimize unwanted excitations of the coupler and obtain gate errors of $10^{-2}$ for gate times below 60~ns. At longer durations, our gate is limited by relaxation of the coupler. Our results show how carefully designed control pulses can speed up frequency selective entangling gates."
Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces,"Tobias Fritz, Antonio Lorenzin",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13708v1,"Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art."

When displaced from the rf null, the ion is superimposed by fast oscillations known as micromotion, which can be probed through motion-sensitive light-atom interactions. In this work, we report on the emergence of the rf pseudo-null, a locus of points where the ion responds to light as if it were at the true rf null, despite being displaced from it. The phenomenon is fully explained by accounting for the general two-dimensional structure of micromotion and is experimentally verified under various potential configurations, with observations in great agreement with numerical simulations. The rf pseudo-null manifests as a line in a two-dimensional parameter space, determined by the geometry of the incident light and its overlap with the motional structure of the ion.

Bassler,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13646v1,"Dicke superradiance describes an ensemble of $N$ permutationally invariant two-level systems collectively emitting radiation with a peak radiated intensity scaling as $N^2$. Although individual Dicke states are typically entangled, the density matrix during superradiant decay is a mixture of such states, raising the subtle question of whether the total state is entangled or separable. We resolve this by showing analytically that for all $N$, starting from the fully excited state, the collective decay preserves separability for all times. This answers a longstanding question on the role of entanglement in Dicke superradiance and underscores that, despite collective dissipation, separable states remain separable under these dynamics."
Realizing exceptional points by Floquet dissipative couplings in thermal atoms,"Zimo Zhang, Fengbo Zhang, Zhongxiao Xu, Ying Hu, Han Bao, Heng Shen",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13616v1,"Exceptional degeneracies and generically complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems are at the heart of numerous phenomena absent in the Hermitian realm. Recently, it was suggested that Floquet dissipative coupling in the space-time domain may provide a novel mechanism to drive intriguing spectral topology with no static analogues, though its experimental investigation in quantum systems remains elusive. We demonstrate such Floquet dissipative coupling in an ensemble of thermal atoms interacting with two spatially separated optical beams, and observe an anomalous anti-parity-time symmetry phase transition at an exception point far from the phase-transition threshold of the static counterpart. Our protocol sets the stage for Floquet engineering of non-Hermitian topological spectra, and for engineering new quantum phases that cannot exist in static systems."
Speedup Chip Yield Analysis by Improved Quantum Bayesian Inference,"Zi-Ming Li, Zeji Li, Tie-Fu Li, Yu-xi Liu",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13613v1,"The semiconductor chip manufacturing process is complex and lengthy, and potential errors arise at every stage. Each wafer contains numerous chips, and wafer bin maps can be generated after chip testing. By analyzing the defect patterns on these wafer bin maps, the steps in the manufacturing process where errors occurred can be inferred. In this letter, we propose an improved quantum Bayesian inference to accelerate the identification of error patterns on wafer bin maps, thereby assisting in chip yield analysis. We outline the algorithm for error identification and detail the implementation of improved quantum Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate the speed advantage of quantum computation over classical algorithms with a real-world problem, highlighting the practical significance of quantum computation."
Adaptive Lattice Gas Algorithm: Classical and Quantum implementations,"Niccolò Fonio, Ljubomir Budinski, Valtteri Lahtinen, Pierre Sagaut",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13549v1,"Lattice gas algorithms (LGA) are a class of algorithms including, in chronological order, binary lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), integer lattice gas algorithms (ILGA) and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). They are largely used for simulating non-linear systems. Starting from 1-dimensional ILGA, we design an algorithm where we carry out a fraction of the possible collisions. These fractions are then adapted to reproduce LBM equilibrium distributions, resulting in an adaptive lattice gas algorithm (ALGA) that achieves the same simulation results of LBM. Considering this, we develop a quantum algorithm that involves a linear collision operator and capable of simulating the same phenomena, while still using a measurement and reinitialization procedure."
Quantum Walks-Based Adaptive Distribution Generation with Efficient CUDA-Q Acceleration,"Yen-Jui Chang, Wei-Ting Wang, Chen-Yu Liu, Yun-Yuan Wang, Ching-Ray Chang",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13532v1,"We present a novel Adaptive Distribution Generator that leverages a quantum walks-based approach to generate high precision and efficiency of target probability distributions. Our method integrates variational quantum circuits with discrete-time quantum walks, specifically, split-step quantum walks and their entangled extensions, to dynamically tune coin parameters and drive the evolution of quantum states towards desired distributions. This enables accurate one-dimensional probability modeling for applications such as financial simulation and structured two-dimensional pattern generation exemplified by digit representations(0~9). Implemented within the CUDA-Q framework, our approach exploits GPU acceleration to significantly reduce computational overhead and improve scalability relative to conventional methods. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that our Quantum Walks-Based Adaptive Distribution Generator achieves high simulation fidelity and bridges the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical high-performance computation."
Logical channel for heralded and pure loss with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code,"Tom B. Harris, Takaya Matsuura, Ben Q. Baragiola, Nicolas C. Menicucci",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13497v1,"Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for ""heralded loss,"" when some loss mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production."
Simulating Nonlinearity in Quantum Neural Networks While Mitigating Barren Plateaus,Ding-Dang Yang,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13980v1,"Quantum neural networks (QNNs) encounter significant challenges in realizing nonlinear behavior and effectively optimizing parameters. This study addresses these issues by modeling nonlinearity through a Taylor series expansion, where the method uses tensor products to generate the series basis, and parameterized unitary matrices define the corresponding coefficients. This design substantially reduces quantum circuit depth compared to conventional methods that rely on parameterized quantum gates, thereby mitigating the barren plateau problem. A QNN was implemented and tested on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets to evaluate the proposed method, achieving test accuracies of 98.7% and 88.3%, respectively. With noise added, the accuracy decreased slightly to 98.6% and 87.2%."
Chirality-induced quantum nonreciprocity,"Zimo Zhang, Zhongxiao Xu, Ran Huang, Xingda Lu, Fengbo Zhang, Donghao Li, Şahin K. Özdemir, Franco Nori, Han Bao, Yanhong Xiao, Bing Chen, Hui Jing, Heng Shen",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13437v2,"Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology."
Tight upper bound and monogamy relation for the maximum quantum value of the parity-CHSH inequality and applied to device-independent randomness,"Guannan Zhang, Jiamin Xu, Ming Li, Shuqian Shen, Lei Li, Shao-ming Fei",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13427v1,"Based on the violation of Bell inequalities, we can verify quantum random numbers by examining the correlation between device inputs and outputs. In this paper, we derive the maximum quantum value of the parity-CHSH inequality for a three-qubit system, establishing a tight upper bound applicable to any quantum state. Simultaneously, the necessary constraints for achieving saturation are analyzed. Utilizing this method, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for certain states to violate the parity-CHSH inequality. Building upon our proposal, the relationship between the noise parameter and the certifiable randomness in a bipartite entangled state is probed. Furthermore, we derive a monogamy relationship between the average values of the parity-CHSH inequality associated with the reduced three-qubit density matrices of GHZ-class states comprising four qubits."
Unraveling Dicke Superradiant Decay with Separable Coherent Spin States,"Pedro Rosario, Luiz O. R. Solak, A. Cidrim, R. Bachelard, Johannes Schachenmayer",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13418v1,"We show that Dicke superradiant decay from a fully inverted state can at all times be described by a positive statistical mixture of coherent spin states (CSS). Since CSS are separable, this implies that no entanglement is involved in Dicke decay. Based on this result, we introduce a new numerical quantum trajectory approach leading to low-entanglement unravelings. This opens up possibilities for large-scale numerical simulations of collective decay processes."
Ultrabroad resonance of localized plasmon on a nanoparticle coupled with surface plasmon on a nanowire enabling two-photon excited emission via continuous-wave laser,"Tamitake Itoh, Yuko S. Yamamoto",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13417v1,"This study found that plasmonic hotspots (HSs) between silver nanoparticles (NPs) and silver nanowires (NWs) generated two-photon excited emissions, including hyper-Rayleigh, hyper-Raman, and two-photon fluorescence of dye molecules with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation. A comparison between experimental results and electromagnetic (EM) calculations revealed that a large EM enhancement factor (FR) at the HS appears in the visible to NIR regions owing to EM coupling between localized plasmons of the NP and surface plasmons of the NW. This ultrabroad resonance of the coupled plasmons enables the observation of two-photon-excited emissions with CW laser excitation. A comparison of the dependence of the NP diameter, NW diameter, and gap distance on two-photon-excited emissions further demonstrated that the large HS-by-HS variations in the emission intensities were mainly induced by the sensitivity of FR to the gap distance at the HSs. We also experimentally and theoretically investigated the propagation of two-photon-excited emission light to a neighboring NP on the NW via surface plasmons."
Adaptive Non-local Observable on Quantum Neural Networks,"Hsin-Yi Lin, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Shinjae Yoo",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13414v1,"Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.   Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network."
Quantum repeaters enhanced by vacuum beam guides,"Yu Gan, Mohadeseh Azar, Nitish Kumar Chandra, Xin Jin, Jinglei Cheng, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan, Junyu Liu",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13397v1,"The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities."
