Multi-Target Rydberg Gates via Spatial Blockade Engineering,"Samuel Stein, Chenxu Liu, Shuwen Kan, Eleanor Crane, Yufei Ding, Ying Mao, Alexander Shuckert, Ang Li",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15282v1,"Multi-target gates offer the potential to reduce gate depth in syndrome extraction for quantum error correction. Although neutral-atom quantum computers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that avoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to single-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\otimes N}) gates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control and have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages tailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the control and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we design smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up to 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom placement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path to implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly reducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction."
Improved Algorithms for Quantum MaxCut via Partially Entangled Matchings,"Anuj Apte, Eunou Lee, Kunal Marwaha, Ojas Parekh, James Sud",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15276v1,"We introduce a $0.611$-approximation algorithm for Quantum MaxCut and a $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809$-approximation algorithm for the EPR Hamiltonian of [arXiv:2209.02589]. A novel ingredient in both of these algorithms is to partially entangle pairs of qubits associated to edges in a matching, while preserving the direction of their single-qubit Bloch vectors. This allows us to interpolate between product states and matching-based states with a tunable parameter."
Realization of maximally-entangling two-qutrit gates using the Cross-Resonance scheme,"Yash Saxena, Sagnik Chatterjee, Tharrmashastha Sapv",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15265v1,"Three-level systems have natural advantages over their two-level counterparts in quantum information and computation. Although generally used for qubits, the existing superconducting transmon architecture can naturally be extended to three levels, which allows the exploration of the entire qutrit Hilbert space. Realizing a maximally entangling two-qutrit gate is necessary for universal quantum computation using three-level systems. Our work extends the state-of-the-art approach by providing a theoretical framework for realizing a high-fidelity two-qutrit generalized CR gate using the cross-resonance framework. Using our framework, we experimentally demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$\sqrt{X}$ gates through simulations on QISKIT dynamics, which in turn allow us to obtain a maximum extracted concurrence of $97.2\pm0.1\%$, thereby demonstrating that entanglement has been achieved on all three levels. Using the above gates, we also prepare a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $96.9\pm 0.1\%$."
Sunflowers and Ramsey problems for restricted intersections,"Barnabás Janzer, Zhihan Jin, Benny Sudakov, Kewen Wu",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15264v1,"Extremal problems on set systems with restricted intersections have been an important part of combinatorics in the last 70 year. In this paper, we study the following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\subseteq \{0,\dots,k-1\}$ and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not contain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size in $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on $m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum computing.   As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\""uredi's celebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system method. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on the uniformity in F\""uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with significantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is still strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method."
Broadband Fourier transform spectroscopy of quantum emitters photoluminescence with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution,"Issam Belgacem, Pasquale Cilibrizzi, Muhammad Junaid Arshad, Daniel White, Malte Kroj, Christiaan Bekker, Margherita Mazzera, Brian D. Gerardot, Angelo C. Frangeskou, Gavin W. Morley, Nguyen Tien Son, Jawad Ul-Hassan, Takeshi Ohshima, Hiroshi Abe, Lorenzo Vinco, Dario Polli, Giulio Cerullo, Cristian Bonato",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15258v1,"The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast timescales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales."
Quantum-enhanced second harmonic generation beyond the photon pairs regime,"Thomas Dickinson, Ivi Afxenti, Giedre Astrauskaite, Lennart Hirsch, Samuel Nerenberg, Ottavia Jedrkiewicz, Daniele Faccio, Caroline Müllenbroich, Alessandra Gatti, Matteo Clerici, Lucia Caspani",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15249v1,"Two-photon processes are crucial in applications like microscopy and microfabrication, but their low cross-section requires intense illumination and limits, e.g., the penetration depth in nonlinear microscopy. Entangled states have been proposed to enhance the efficiency of two-photon interactions and have shown effectiveness at low intensities. This quantum enhancement is generally believed to be lost at high intensities, for more than one photon per mode, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explored experimentally and theoretically two-photon processes driven by entangled photons at intensities beyond this threshold and compared the results with the classical case. We found that a quantum advantage can still be observed at nearly one order of magnitude higher intensities than previously assumed. Our findings show a potential path for exploiting quantum-enhanced two-photon processes in practical applications."
Rydberg Atoms in a Ladder Geometry: Quench Dynamics and Floquet Engineering,"Mainak Pal, Tista Banerjee",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15230v1,"In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as novel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to particle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct test of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics starting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the fate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\Omega$ and a detuning profile which is staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\Delta$. As the staggering strength $\Delta$ is tuned from $\Delta/\Omega=0\rightarrow\infty$, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i) quantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\Delta/\Omega \sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\Delta/\Omega \gg 1$) . Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of this model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact Floquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical features against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols, long-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the environment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the Rydberg excited state."
Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point,Aditya Banerjee,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203v1,"The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several ""fine-grained"" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems."
Quantum phase discrimination with applications to quantum search on graphs,"Guanzhong Li, Lvzhou Li, Jingquan Luo",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15194v1,"We study the phase discrimination problem, in which we want to decide whether the eigenphase $\theta\in(-\pi,\pi]$ of a given eigenstate $|\psi\rangle$ with eigenvalue $e^{i\theta}$ is zero or not, using applications of the unitary $U$ provided as a black box oracle.We propose a quantum algorithm named {\it quantum phase discrimination(QPD)} for this task, with optimal query complexity $\Theta(\frac{1}{\lambda}\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ to the oracle $U$, where $\lambda$ is the gap between zero and non-zero eigenphases and $\delta$ the allowed one-sided error. The quantum circuit is simple, consisting of only one ancillary qubit and a sequence of controlled-$U$ interleaved with single qubit $Y$ rotations, whose angles are given by a simple analytical formula. Quantum phase discrimination could become a fundamental subroutine in other quantum algorithms, as we present two applications to quantum search on graphs:   i) Spatial search on graphs. Inspired by the structure of QPD, we propose a new quantum walk model, and based on them we tackle the spatial search problem, obtaining a novel quantum search algorithm. For any graph with any number of marked vertices, the quantum algorithm that can find a marked vertex with probability $\Omega(1)$ in total evolution time $ O(\frac{1}{\lambda \sqrt{\varepsilon}})$ and query complexity $ O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$, where $\lambda$ is the gap between the zero and non-zero eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian and $\varepsilon$ is a lower bound on the proportion of marked vertices.   ii) Path-finding on graphs.} By using QPD, we reduce the query complexity of a path-finding algorithm proposed by Li and Zur [arxiv: 2311.07372] from $\tilde{O}(n^{11})$ to $\tilde{O}(n^8)$, in a welded-tree circuit graph with $\Theta(n2^n)$ vertices.   Besides these two applications, we argue that more quantum algorithms might benefit from QPD."
Method for simulating open-system dynamics using mid-circuit measurements on a quantum computer,"John P. T. Stenger, Gloria Bazargan, Nicholas T. Bronn, Daniel Gunlycke",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15187v1,"We present a method for simulating the dynamics of an open electronic system on a quantum computer. This approach entails mid-circuit measurements and resets to simulate the addition or removal of fermions from the system and provides a way to apply non-reversible operations to a quantum computer. Using this method, we simulate the dynamics of an open electronic system consisting of a fermionic chain positioned between two conductive leads on the $ibm\_torino$ quantum computer."
Multiple Quantum Many-Body Clustering Probed by Dynamical Decoupling,"Gerónimo Sequeiros, Claudia M. Sánchez, Lisandro Buljubasich, Ana K. Chattah, Horacio M. Pastawski, Rodolfo H. Acosta",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15183v1,"The manipulation of quantum information in large systems requires precise control of quantum systems that are out-of-equilibrium. As the size of the system increases, its fragility in response to external perturbations and intrinsic decoherence processes also increases. The degradation of the system response makes accurate measurements a challenging and time-consuming task. However, quantum information lifetime enhancement can be achieved by dynamical decoupling techniques (DD), where an external drive with a frequency much higher than the system's internal evolution renders signal acquisition with decay times greater than 1000-fold. In this study, we demonstrate that the system response during a prethermal period, subject to Floquet control, can be utilized to probe the multiple quantum evolution of dense and highly connected spin systems. This approach exhibits an enhanced sensitivity at a reduced experimental time. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio achieved enabled the use of numerical inversion strategies to model the evolution of the excited multiple quantum coherences, which describe the number of correlated spins within a cluster. We observed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the increase in the number of correlated spins with multiple quantum evolution is accompanied by an increase in the distribution of spin cluster sizes, which follows a quadratic law."
Geometric speed limit of state preparation and curved control spaces,"Maximilian Goll, Robert H. Jonsson",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15175v1,"The preparation of quantum many-body systems faces the difficulty that in a realistic scenario only few control parameters of the system may be accessible. In this context, an interesting connection between the energy fluctuations during state preparation and its geometric length as measured by the Fubini-Study metric was discussed in Bukov et al., ""Geometric Speed Limit of Accessible Many-Body State Preparation"", Phys. Rev. X 9, 011034 (2019). An inspiring conjecture was put forward lower bounding the energy fluctuations by the minimal geometric length of all accessible state preparation protocols. We here show that the conjecture holds if the accessible parameter space has no extrinsic curvature, when embedded into the space of all dynamically accessible states. If the parameter space has extrinsic curvature a weakened version of the conjecture applies. We discuss instructive examples for a qubit system and harmonic oscillators."
Quantum Excitation Transfer in an Artificial Photosynthetic Light-Harvesting System,"Stephon Alexander, Roger Andrews, Oliver Fox, Sarben Sarkar",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15172v1,"We analytically derive transfer probabilities and efficiencies for an artificial light-harvesting photosynthetic system, which consists of a ring coupled to a central acceptor. For an incident photon pair, we find near-perfect single excitation transfer efficiency with negligible double excitation transfer in the weak coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, single excitation transfer efficiency was greater than 90%, while the double excitation efficiency was approximately 50%. We have found that the three main factors which determine high transfer efficiencies are large acceptor probabilities, long acceptor decay times, and strong photon-ring coupling. A possible implementation of the theoretical framework to bio-inspired solar energy devices is also discussed."
Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators,"Daichi Nakamura, Kohei Kawabata",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15154v1,"Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands."
Breaking Down Quantum Compilation: Profiling and Identifying Costly Passes,"Felix Zilk, Alessandro Tundo, Vincenzo De Maio, Ivona Brandic",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15141v1,"With the increasing capabilities of quantum systems, the efficient, practical execution of quantum programs is becoming more critical. Each execution includes compilation time, which accounts for substantial overhead of the overall program runtime. To address this challenge, proposals that leverage precompilation techniques have emerged, whereby entire circuits or select components are precompiled to mitigate the compilation time spent during execution. Considering the impact of compilation time on quantum program execution, identifying the contribution of each individual compilation task to the execution time is necessary in directing the community's research efforts towards the development of an efficient compilation and execution pipeline. In this work, we perform a preliminary analysis of the quantum circuit compilation process in Qiskit, examining the cumulative runtime of each individual compilation task and identifying the tasks that most strongly impact the overall compilation time. Our results indicate that, as the desired level of optimization increases, circuit optimization and gate synthesis passes become the dominant tasks in compiling a Quantum Fourier Transform, with individual passes consuming up to 87% of the total compilation time. Mapping passes require the most compilation time for a GHZ state preparation circuit, accounting for over 99% of total compilation time."
Fully connected twin-field quantum key distribution network,"Chunfeng Huang, Rui Guan, Xin Liu, Shizhuo Li, Wenjie He, Hao Liang, Ziyang Luo, Zhenrong Zhang, Wei Li, Kejin Wei",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15137v1,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key application in quantum communication, enabling secure key exchange between parties using quantum states. Twin-field (TF) QKD offers a promising solution that surpasses the repeaterless limits, and its measurement-device-independent nature makes it suitable for star-type network architectures. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fully connected TF-QKD network architecture, where users prepare quantum signals and send them to network nodes. These nodes use splitters to route the signals to measurement units, enabling secure key distribution among arbitrary users. A proof-of-principle demonstration with three users successfully achieved secure key sharing over simulated link losses of up to 30 dB, with an average rate of $5.01 \times 10^{-7}$ bit per pulse. Additionally, simulations show that the architecture can support up to $32$ users with a secure key rate of 280.90 bits/s under typical fiber loss conditions. This approach represents a significant advancement in the topology of untrusted-node QKD networks and holds promise for practical, large-scale applications in secure communication."
Efficient simulation of Clifford circuits with small Markovian errors,"Ashe Miller, Corey Ostrove, Jordan Hines, Robin Blume-Kohout, Kevin Young, Timothy Proctor",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15128v1,"Classical simulation of noisy quantum circuits is essential for understanding quantum computing experiments. It enables scalable error characterization, analysis of how noise impacts quantum algorithms, and optimized implementations of quantum error correction. However, most existing efficient simulation techniques can only simulate the effects of stochastic (incoherent) noise. The lack of efficient ways to simulate coherent errors, which are common and significant in contemporary quantum computing systems, has frustrated research. We remedy this gap by introducing an efficient algorithm for approximate simulation of Clifford circuits with arbitrary small errors (including coherent errors) that can be described by sparse $n$-qubit Lindbladians. We use this algorithm to study the impact of coherent errors on syndrome extract circuits for distance-3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 rotated surface codes, and on deep random 225-qubit circuits containing over a million gates."
Squeezing Effect in the Gouy Phase of Matter Waves,"Thiago M. S. Oliveira, Lucas S. Marinho, F. C. V. de Brito, Marcos Sampaio, Irismar G. da Paz",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15123v1,"We investigate the Gouy phase emerging from the time evolution of confined matter waves in a harmonic potential. Specifically, we analyze the quantum dynamics of a Gaussian wavepacket that exhibits position--momentum correlations. By tuning the parameters governing its evolution, we reveal intriguing effects, with a particular focus on squeezing. Notably, during the wavepacket evolution quantum spreading and squeezing processes emerge, giving rise to Gouy phase contributions of $\pi/4$ rad, establishing a clear link between the Gouy phase and a purely quantum phenomenon. Furthermore, the interplay between wavepacket squeezing and one-dimensional spreading leads to a total Gouy phase accumulation of $\pi/2$ rad in an oscillation period. Both squeezing and Gouy phase have individually proven valuable in state engineering and quantum metrology. By demonstrating a direct, controllable relationship between these two fundamental processes, our findings expand the realm of quantum-enhanced technologies, including quantum sensing and precision measurement."
Sensing with Quantum Light: A perspective,Animesh Datta,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15114v1,"I present my perspective on sensing with quantum light. I summarise the motivations and methodology for identifying quantum enhancements in sensing over a classical sensor. In the real world, this enhancement will be a constant factor, and not increase with the size of the quantum probe as is often advertised. I use a limited survey of interferometry, microscopy, and spectroscopy to extract the vital challenges that must be faced to realise tangible enhancements in sensing with quantum light."
Wireless energy transfer in non-Hermitian quantum battery,"Fang-Mei Yang, Fu-Quan Dou",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15091v1,"The extraction of energy is one of fundamental challenges in realizing quantum batteries (QBs). Here, we propose two wireless transfer schemes with parity-time symmetries to efficiently extract the energy stored in non-Hermitian QBs to consumption centers. For linear cases, the transfer energy oscillates periodically in the unbroken symmetry region and grows hyperbolically in the broken region. For nonlinear cases, the transfer energy eventually reach and remain steady-state values arising from the feedback mechanism of the nonlinear saturable gain. Furthermore, we show the significant robustness and the ultrafast response of the wireless transfer schemes to sudden movements around one metre. Our work overcomes energy bottlenecks for wireless transfer schemes in QBs and may provide inspirations for practical applications of QBs."
Automated discovery and optimization of autonomous quantum error correction codes for a general open quantum system,Sahel Ashhab,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15070v1,"We develop a method to search for the optimal code space, induced decay rates and control Hamiltonian to implement autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) for a general open quantum system. The system is defined by a free-evolution Lindbladian superoperator, which contains the free Hamiltonian and naturally occurring decoherence terms, as well as the control superoperators. The performance metric for optimization is the fidelity between the projector onto the code space and the same projector after Lindbladian evolution for a specified time. We use a gradient-based search to update the code words, induced decay matrix and control Hamiltonian matrix. We apply the method to optimize AQEC codes for a variety of few-level systems. The four-level system with uniform decay rates offers a simple example for testing and illustrating the operation of our approach. The algorithm reliably succeeds in finding the optimal code in this case, while success becomes probabilistic for more complicated cases. For a five-level system with photon loss decay, the algorithm finds good AQEC codes, but these codes are not as good as the well-known binomial code. We use the binomial code as a starting point to search for the optimal code for a perturbed five-level system. In this case, the algorithm finds a code that is better than both the original binomial code and any other code obtained numerically when starting from a random initial guess."
Failure of the comformal-map method for relativistic quantum billiards,Barbara Dietz,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15055v1,"We demonstrate that the conformal-map method introduced by Robnik in 1984 for nonrelativistic quantum billiards is not applicable for the quantization of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs) consisting of a massless non-interacting spin-1/2 particle confined to a two-dimensional domain. To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are corroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic quantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of the properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics."
Quantum pseudoresources imply cryptography,"Alex B. Grilo, Álvaro Yángüez",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15025v1,"While one-way functions (OWFs) serve as the minimal assumption for computational cryptography in the classical setting, in quantum cryptography, we have even weaker cryptographic assumptions such as pseudo-random states, and EFI pairs, among others. Moreover, the minimal assumption for computational quantum cryptography remains an open question. Recently, it has been shown that pseudoentanglement is necessary for the existence of quantum cryptography (Goul\~ao and Elkouss 2024), but no cryptographic construction has been built from it.   In this work, we study the cryptographic usefulness of quantum pseudoresources -- a pair of families of quantum states that exhibit a gap in their resource content yet remain computationally indistinguishable. We show that quantum pseudoresources imply a variant of EFI pairs, which we call EPFI pairs, and that these are equivalent to quantum commitments and thus EFI pairs. Our results suggest that, just as randomness is fundamental to classical cryptography, quantum resources may play a similarly crucial role in the quantum setting.   Finally, we focus on the specific case of entanglement, analyzing different definitions of pseudoentanglement and their implications for constructing EPFI pairs. Moreover, we propose a new cryptographic functionality that is intrinsically dependent on entanglement as a resource."
Trainable Quantum Neural Network for Multiclass Image Classification with the Power of Pre-trained Tree Tensor Networks,"Keisuke Murota, Takumi Kobori",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14995v1,"Tree tensor networks (TTNs) offer powerful models for image classification. While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification."
Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems,"Jithin T Surendran, Indrajeet D Prasad, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Santosh Kumar",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14986v1,"Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale."
Nonreciprocal photon blockade induced by parametric amplification in an asymmetrical cavity,"Shao-Xiong Wu, Xue-Chen Gao, Huan-Huan Cheng, Cheng-Hua Bai",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14974v1,"We propose a scheme to generate and manipulate nonreciprocal photon blockade effect in an asymmetrical Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity, which consists of a single two-level atom and a second-order nonlinear medium. By utilizing the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of cavity and applying a parametric amplification pumping laser to the nonlinear medium, we can realize direction-dependent single-photon and two-photon blockade effects. For nonreciprocal single-photon blockade, our proposal is robust across a wide range of parameters, such as the cavity or atomic detuning, coupling strength, and atomic decay. Within similar parameter ranges, nonreciprocal two-photon blockade can be achieved and modulated by finely adjusting the parametric amplification pumping. Our project offers a feasible access to generating high-quality and tunable nonreciprocal single/two-photon source and paves a new avenue for investigating the nonreciprocity of photon quantum statistical properties."
Advancing quantum process tomography through universal compilation,"Huynh Le Dan Linh, Vu Tuan Hai, Le Bin Ho",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14958v1,"Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for characterizing operations in quantum gates and circuits, however, existing methods face scalability and noise sensitivity challenges.

This method utilizes efficient algorithms to improve accuracy while reducing resource requirements. We benchmark our approach through numerical simulations of random unitary gates, demonstrating highly accurate quantum process characterization. Additionally, we apply it to dephasing processes with time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous noise, achieving improved fidelity and robustness. Our work further enables broader applications in quantum error correction and device validation."
Parallel Kac's Walk Generates PRU,"Chuhan Lu, Minglong Qin, Fang Song, Penghui Yao, Mingnan Zhao",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14957v1,"Ma and Huang recently proved that the PFC construction, introduced by Metger, Poremba, Sinha and Yuen [MPSY24], gives an adaptive-secure pseudorandom unitary family PRU.

In this work, we show that a linear number of sequential repetitions of the parallel Kac's Walk, introduced by Lu, Qin, Song, Yao and Zhao [LQSY+24], also forms an adaptive-secure PRU, confirming a conjecture therein. Moreover, it additionally satisfies strong security against adversaries making inverse queries. This gives an alternative PRU construction, and provides another instance demonstrating the power of the path recording technique. We also discuss some further simplifications and implications."
Solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in external Yang-Mills gauge field,V. V. Parazian,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14953v1,Exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in an external non-Abelian gauge field with an SU(N) symmetry group have been obtained. The external field is a solution of the Yang-Mills equations and describes a plane wave on the light cone. The obtained solutions form a complete set and can be used in the procedure of canonical quantization of scalar fields.
Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization,Stefano Longhi,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14910v1,"A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics."
Converting $PT$-Symmetric Topological Classes by Floquet Engineering,"Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14846v1,"Going beyond the conventional classification rule of Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, $PT$ symmetric topological phases are classified by $(PT)^2=1$ or $-1$. The interconversion between the two $PT$-symmetric topological classes is generally difficult due to the constraint of $(PT)^2$. Here, we propose a scheme to control and interconvert the $PT$-symmetric topological classes by Floquet engineering. We find that it is the breakdown of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge, induced by the $\pi$ phase difference between different hopping rates, by the periodic driving that leads to such an interconversion. Relaxing the system from the constraint of $(PT)^2$, rich exotic topological phases, e.g., the coexisting $PT$-symmetric first-order real Chern insulator and second-order topological insulators not only in different quasienergy gaps, but also in one single gap, are generated. In contrast to conventional Floquet topological phases, our result provides a way to realize exotic topological phases without changing symmetries. It enriches the family of topological phases and gives an insightful guidance for the development of multifunctional quantum devices."
(Sub)Exponential Quantum Speedup for Optimization,"Jiaqi Leng, Kewen Wu, Xiaodi Wu, Yufan Zheng",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14841v1,"We demonstrate provable (sub)exponential quantum speedups in both discrete and continuous optimization, achieved through simple and natural quantum optimization algorithms, namely the quantum adiabatic algorithm for discrete optimization and quantum Hamiltonian descent for continuous optimization. Our result builds on the Gily\'en--Hastings--Vazirani (sub)exponential oracle separation for adiabatic quantum computing. With a sequence of perturbative reductions, we compile their construction into two standalone objective functions, whose oracles can be directly leveraged by the plain adiabatic evolution and Schr\""odinger operator evolution for discrete and continuous optimization, respectively."
Variational quantum algorithm for the Poisson equation based on the banded Toeplitz systems,"Xiaoqi Liu, Yuedi Qu, Ming Li, Shu-qian Shen",2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14828v1,"For solving the Poisson equation it is usually possible to discretize it into solving the corresponding linear system $Ax=b$.Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for the discreted Poisson equation have been studied before. We give a VQA based on the banded Toeplitz systems for solving the Poisson equation with respect to the structural features of matrix $A$. In detail, we decompose the matrix $A$ and $A^2$ into a linear combination of the corresponding banded Toeplitz matrix and sparse matrices with only a few non-zero elements. For the one-dimensional Poisson equation with different boundary conditions and the $d$-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the number of decomposition terms is less than the work in [Phys. Rev. A 108, 032418 (2023)]. Based on the decomposition of the matrix, we design quantum circuits that evaluate efficiently the cost function.Additionally, numerical simulation verifies the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. In the end, the VQAs for linear systems of equations and matrix-vector multiplications with $K$-banded Teoplitz matrix $T_n^K$ are given, where $T_n^K\in R^{n\times n}$ and $K\in O({\rm ploy}\log n)$."
Categorifying Clifford QCA,Bowen Yang,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14811v1,"We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework."
Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation,Xing M. Wang,2025-04-21,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791v1,"The interpretation of quantum measurements presents a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics, with concepts such as the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), and Bohmian Mechanics (BM) offering distinct perspectives. We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI), which describes measurement as branching the local Hilbert space of a system into parallel subspaces. We formalize the mathematical framework of BHSI using branching and the engaging and disengaging unitary operators to relationally and causally update the states of observers. Unlike the MWI, BHSI avoids the ontological proliferation of worlds and copies of observers, realizing the Born rule based on branch weights. Unlike the CI, BHSI retains the essential features of the MWI: unitary evolution and no wavefunction collapse. Unlike the BM, BHSI does not depend on a nonlocal structure, which may conflict with relativity. We apply BHSI to examples such as the double-slit experiment, the Bell test, Wagner and his friend, and the black hole information paradox. In addition, we explore whether recohering branches can be achieved in BHSI. Compared to the CI and MWI, BHSI provides a minimalist, unitarity-preserving, collapse-free, and probabilistically inherent alternative interpretation of quantum measurements."
Geometric Learning Dynamics,Vitaly Vanchurin,2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14728v1,"We present a unified geometric framework for modeling learning dynamics in physical, biological, and machine learning systems. The theory reveals three fundamental regimes, each emerging from the power-law relationship $g \propto \kappa^a$ between the metric tensor $g$ in the space of trainable variables and the noise covariance matrix $\kappa$. The quantum regime corresponds to $a = 1$ and describes Schr\""odinger-like dynamics that emerges from a discrete shift symmetry. The efficient learning regime corresponds to $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and describes very fast machine learning algorithms. The equilibration regime corresponds to $a = 0$ and describes classical models of biological evolution. We argue that the emergence of the intermediate regime $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a key mechanism underlying the emergence of biological complexity."
Unconventional Chemical Bonding of Lanthanide-OH Molecules,"Jacek Kłos, Eite Tiesinga, Lan Cheng, Svetlana Kotochigova",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14698v1,"We present a theoretical study of the low lying adiabatic relativistic electronic states of lanthanide monohydroxide (Ln-OH) molecules near their linear equilibrium geometries. We focus on heavy, magnetic DyOH and ErOH relevant to fundamental symmetry tests. We use a restricted-active-space self-consistent field method combined with spin-orbit coupling as well as a relativistic coupled-cluster method. In addition, electric dipole and magnetic moments are computed with the self-consistent field method. Analysis of the results from both methods shows that the dominant molecular configuration of the ground state is one where an electron from the partially filled and submerged 4f orbital of the lanthanide atom moves to the hydroxyl group, leaving the closed outer-most 6s$^2$ lone electron pair of the lanthanide atom intact in sharp contrast to the bonding in alkaline-earth monohydroxides and YbOH, where an electron from the outer-most s shell moves to the hydroxyl group. For linear molecules the projection of the total electron angular momentum on the symmetry axis is a conserved quantity with quantum number $\Omega$ and we study the polynomial $\Omega$ dependence of the energies of the ground states as well as their electric and magnetic moments. We find that the lowest energy states have $|\Omega|=15/2$ and 1/2 for DyOH and ErOH, respectively. The zero field splittings among these $\Omega$ states is approximately $hc\times 1\,000$~cm$^{-1}$. We find that the permanent dipole moments for both triatomics are fairly small at 0.23 atomic units. The magnetic moments are closely related to that of the corresponding atomic Ln$^+$ ion in an excited electronic state. We also realize that the total electron angular momentum is to good approximation conserved and has a quantum number of 15/2 for both triatomic molecules."
Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates,"Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685v1,"This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects."
Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems,"Tamoghna Ray, Abhishek Dhar, Manas Kulkarni",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675v1,"We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics."
Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line,"Luca Giacomelli, Michel H. Devoret, Cristiano Ciuti",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14651v1,"We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions."

Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the overall performance when two arbitrary and asymmetric sources the MDI users employ. As a specific application, we calculate the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare this result to the cases with symmetric sources. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources. Since requiring all users to employ identical sources in a network is unreasonable, our theory paves the way for the practical deployment of MDI-QKD networks."

Using a transfer matrix approach, we develop a protocol for deterministic phase gate operation, demonstrating its robustness against non-waveguide mode coupling and disorder. Finally, we relax the idealized assumption of monochromatic light, considering finite-bandwidth pulses. Despite these realistic considerations, our results indicate high fidelity for the proposed phase gate protocol. Finally we will discuss two qubit operations."

Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality."
Quantum-Enhanced Weight Optimization for Neural Networks Using Grover's Algorithm,"Stefan-Alexandru Jura, Mihai Udrescu",2025-04-20,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14568v1,"The main approach to hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (QNN) is employing quantum computing to build a neural network (NN) that has quantum features, which is then optimized classically. Here, we propose a different strategy: to use quantum computing in order to optimize the weights of a classical NN. As such, we design an instance of Grover's quantum search algorithm to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters of an NN during the training process, a task traditionally performed using the backpropagation algorithm with the gradient descent method. Indeed, gradient descent has issues such as exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, or convexity problem. Other methods tried to address such issues with strategies like genetic searches, but they carry additional problems like convergence consistency. Our original method avoids these issues -- because it does not calculate gradients -- and capitalizes on classical architectures' robustness and Grover's quadratic speedup in high-dimensional search spaces to significantly reduce test loss (58.75%) and improve test accuracy (35.25%), compared to classical NN weight optimization, on small datasets. Unlike most QNNs that are trained on small datasets only, our method is also scalable, as it allows the optimization of deep networks; for an NN with 3 hidden layers, trained on the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, we obtained a mean accuracy of 97.7%. Moreover, our method requires a much smaller number of qubits compared to other QNN approaches, making it very practical for near-future quantum computers that will still deliver a limited number of logical qubits."

However, their potential has not been fully unleashed for domain-specific programming languages, where specific domain exhibits unique optimization opportunities for customized improvement. In this paper, we take the first step in exploring multi-agent code generation for quantum programs. By identifying the unique optimizations in quantum designs such as quantum error correction, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework tailored to generating accurate, fault-tolerant quantum code. Each agent in the framework focuses on distinct optimizations, iteratively refining the code using a semantic analyzer with multi-pass inference, alongside an error correction code decoder. We also examine the effectiveness of inference-time techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of quantum programming, uncovering observations that are different from general-purpose code generation. To evaluate our approach, we develop a test suite to measure the impact each optimization has on the accuracy of the generated code. Our findings indicate that techniques such as structured CoT significantly improve the generation of quantum algorithms by up to 50%. In contrast, we have also found that certain techniques such as RAG show limited improvement, yielding an accuracy increase of only 4%. Moreover, we showcase examples of AI-assisted quantum error prediction and correction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-agent framework in reducing the quantum errors of generated quantum programs."

This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional ``level statistics"" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates.

One striking feature of optimal probing state in this task can be observed if we increase the number of unitaries more than two. There exists a class of unitaries in every dimension $\geqslant$ 3 for which an input entangled state cannot distinguish them but an input single state can."

Our method allows multiple quantum states to be observed at different points within a single circuit, one at a time, and saved into classical memory without destruction. These saved states can be accessed on demand by downstream applications, introducing a dynamic and programmable notion of quantum memory that supports modular, non-destructive quantum workflows. We propose a hardware-agnostic, machine learning-driven framework to capture non-destructive estimates, or ""snapshots,"" of quantum states at arbitrary points within a circuit, enabling classical storage and later reconstruction, similar to memory operations in classical computing. This capability is essential for debugging, introspection, and persistent memory in quantum systems, yet remains difficult due to the no-cloning theorem and destructive measurements. Our guess-and-check approach uses fidelity estimation via the SWAP test to guide state reconstruction. We explore both gradient-based deep neural networks and gradient-free evolutionary strategies to estimate quantum states using only fidelity as the learning signal. We demonstrate a key component of our framework on IBM quantum hardware, achieving high-fidelity (approximately 1.0) reconstructions for Hadamard and other known states. In simulation, our models achieve an average fidelity of 0.999 across 100 random quantum states.

Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach,"David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio, Norbert Schuch",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14380v1,"Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters."

While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos."
Application of an upsampling algorithm to quantum state preparation of continuous and discrete probability distributions,R. P.

The quantum circuit of preparation derived from functional data sampled in this way exhibits exponential gate depth, like other divide-and-conquer algorithms, but is transformable to an equivalent circuit of polylogarithmic gate depth. In this study, we derive a polylogarthmic upsampling algorithm for construction of a state vector with amplitudes that are square roots of probabilities sampled from a continuous probability distribution having support over the entire real line. As examples, we prepare state vectors associated with Gaussian and Laplace distributions; state vectors for other continuous probability distributions such as Cauchy and Student's t follow in a similar manner. We also extend the algorithm to include preparation of a state vector whose amplitudes are square roots of an arbitrary distribution of discrete probabilities. Our analyses focus on univariate distributions, but can be extended to multivariate forms. The polylogarithmic upsampling algorithm has financial and scientific application."
Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes,"Yevhenii Morozov, Anatoliy Lapchuk",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342v1,"Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation shows that for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 1^(-9) RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure."

This result solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture stating that a model is integrable only if this model has a 3-local conserved quantity. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation."

Teretenkov",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14312v1,"In this work, we model the temperature measurement as a transformation of the arbitrary state into the Gibbs state. We start with a general formalism of ansatz-posteriors, which includes many usual models of posterior states due to measurement or state preparation. On the one hand, it contains models of selective and non-selective measurements posteriors as special cases, which allows us to consider it as a generalization of usual measurement models. On the other hand, it contains the abovementioned transformation into the Gibbs state as a special case as well. We derive an analog of the master equation in the stroboscopic limit of repeated measurements. Then we apply our general approach to temperature measurement."
Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective,"Anneswa Paul, Upendra Harbola",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14266v1,"Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field."

Refinement orders for quantum programs,"Yuan Feng, Li Zhou",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14158v1,"Refinement is an influential technique used in the verification and development of computer programs. It provides a systematic and rigorous approach to software development through stepwise refinement, where a high-level abstract specification is progressively transformed into an implementation that meets the desired requirements. Central to this technique is the notion of a refinement order, which ensures that each refinement step preserves program correctness. Different orders can be defined with respect to partial and total correctness, as well as for deterministic and nondeterministic programs. In the realm of quantum programs, the theory becomes even more intricate due to the existence of various quantum state predicates, leading to different notions of specifications. This paper thoroughly explores different refinement orders for quantum programs and examines the relationships between them."
Breaking the Diffraction Barrier for Passive Sources: Parameter-Decoupled Superresolution Assisted by Physics-Informed Machine Learning,"Abdelali Sajia, Bilal Benzimoun, Pawan Khatiwada, Guogan Zhao, Xiao-Feng Qian",2025-04-19,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14156v1,"We present a parameter-decoupled superresolution framework for estimating sub-wavelength separations of passive two-point sources without requiring prior knowledge or control of the source. Our theoretical foundation circumvents the need to estimate multiple challenging parameters such as partial coherence, brightness imbalance, random relative phase, and photon statistics. A physics-informed machine learning (ML) model (trained with a standard desktop workstation), synergistically integrating this theory, further addresses practical imperfections including background noise, photon loss, and centroid/orientation misalignment. The integrated parameter-decoupling superresolution method achieves resolution 14 and more times below the diffraction limit (corresponding to ~ 13.5 nm in optical microscopy) on experimentally generated realistic images with >82% fidelity, performance rivaling state-of-the-art techniques for actively controllable sources. Critically, our method's robustness against source parameter variability and source-independent noises enables potential applications in realistic scenarios where source control is infeasible, such as astrophysical imaging, live-cell microscopy, and quantum metrology. This work bridges a critical gap between theoretical superresolution limits and practical implementations for passive systems."
A streamlined demonstration that stabilizer circuits simulation reduces to Boolean linear algebra,Vsevolod I. Yashin,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14101v1,"Gottesman-Knill theorem states that computations on stabilizer circuits can be simulated on a classical computer, conventional simulation algorithms extensively use linear algebra over bit strings. For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations. This approach gives a new perspective on explaining the work of stabilizer tableau methods (reproducing the asymptotics) and creates opportunity for exploring various tensor-contraction techniques in stabilizer simulation."
Lyapunov Dynamics in Entangled Biphoton Spectroscopy,"Sameer Damball, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada, Eric R. Bittner",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14086v1,"Recent advances in quantum light spectroscopy highlight the potential of using entangled photons as a sensitive probe for many-body dynamics and material correlations. However, a comprehensive theory to explain experimental results remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the Hilbert space and the intricate interactions and nonlinearities inherent in material systems. In this work, we introduce a tractable model based on a finite-sized correlation matrix governed by a bilinear bosonic Hamiltonian, enabling efficient simulations through Gaussian-preserving dynamics. We apply this framework to compute the output joint spectral intensity (JSI) and von Neumann entropy of frequency-entangled biphotons, and find close agreement with experimental observations in empty microcavities. Our results reveal the emergence of off-diagonal spectral correlations that can be interpreted as irreversible decay of cavity excitations into the biphoton continua. This approach offers a powerful theoretical tool for interpreting quantum spectroscopic data and paves the way for probing more complex light-matter interactions in materials."
Ptychographic estimation of qudit states encoded in the angular position and orbital angular momentum of single photons,"A. M. da Costa, L. Neves",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14073v1,"Ptychography is a computational imaging technique mainly used in optical and electron microscopy. Its quantum analogue was recently introduced as a simple method for estimating unknown pure quantum states through projections onto partially overlapping subspaces, each one followed by a projective measurement in the Fourier basis. In the end, an iterative algorithm estimates the state from the collected data. Here, we theoretically describe how to implement this method for $D$-dimensional qudit states encoded in the angular position and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of single photons. For this purpose, we define the qudit by discretizing the spatial profile of a photon in cylindrical coordinates, using an array of $D$ angular slits symmetrically distributed in the transverse plane. To apply ptychography to this encoding, we show that the intermediate projections will be carried out by simple binary spatial filters in the angular paths, while the measurement in the Fourier basis will be performed by postselecting $D$ OAM modes compatible with the quantum Fourier transform of the path basis. We illustrate the effectiveness of this scheme through simulations and discuss its experimental feasibility."
Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach,"Van Sy Mai, Abderrahim Amlou, Amar Abane, Abdella Battou",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14040v1,"This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator."

To contextualize the techniques discussed here, demonstrative examples in two prototypical quantum systems, namely colloidal nanocrystals and vacancy centers in diamond, are provided."
Comparative Benchmarking of Utility-Scale Quantum Emulators,"Anna Leonteva, Guido Masella, Maxime Outteryck, Asier Piñeiro Orioli, Shannon Whitlock",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14027v1,"Evaluating quantum algorithms at utility-scale - involving more than 100 qubits - is a key step toward advancing real-world applications of quantum computing.

Performance is assessed on 13 benchmark circuits from the MQTBench library, spanning circuit sizes from 4 to 1,024 qubits. Our results reveal that MPS-based emulators outperform other approaches overall, successfully solving 8 benchmarks up to the maximum size of 1,024 qubits and 12 benchmarks up to at least 100 qubits in less than 5 minutes.

Short remarks on shallow unitary circuits,Jeongwan Haah,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14005v1,(i) We point out that every shallow unitary circuit of depth smaller than the linear system size is easily distinguished from a Haar random unitary if there is a conserved quantity that is a sum of local operators. This is always the case with a continuous onsite symmetry or with a local energy conservation law. (ii) We explain a simple algorithm for a formulation of the shallow unitary circuit learning problem and relate it to an open question on strictly locality-preserving unitaries (quantum cellular automata). (iii) We show that any quantum cellular automaton in $D$-dimensional lattice of volume~$V$ can be implemented using only $O(V)$ local gates in a staircase fashion.

Quantum Contextuality for Contextual Word Embeddings,Karl Svozil,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13824v1,"Conventional word-to-vector embeddings face challenges in representing polysemy, where word meaning is context-dependent. While dynamic embeddings address this, we propose an alternative framework utilizing quantum contextuality. In this approach, words are encoded as single, static vectors within a Hilbert space. Language contexts are formalized as maximal observables, mathematically equivalent to orthonormal bases. A word vector acquires its specific semantic meaning based on the basis (context) it occupies, leveraging the quantum concept of intertwining contexts where a single vector can belong to multiple, mutually complementary bases. This method allows meaning to be constructed through orthogonality relationships inherent in the contextual structure, potentially offering a novel way to statically encode contextual semantics."
Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation,"Siddhant Midha, Sarang Gopalakrishnan",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13815v1,"We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation."

The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures."

Here, the WR-PTP serves as a scalable network synchronization protocol, and its performance is compared to traditional methods of local synchronization. We demonstrate pulse-to-pulse synchronization better than 3 ps and time deviation (TDEV) values below 4 ps for all averaging times up to 10 s.

Furthermore, we develop a variational quantum eigensolver that allows for reliably preparing the ground state of the theory in both the absence and presence of static charges and to capture the static aspects of the phenomenon. Carrying out state preparation on real quantum hardware for up to 19 qubits, we demonstrate its suitability for current quantum devices. In addition, we study the real-time dynamics of a flux tube between two static charges using both Tensor Networks and quantum hardware. Using a trotterization for the time-evolution operator, we are able to show that the breaking process starts with the creation of charges inside the string. These eventually redistribute towards the static charges and screen them, which leads to the breaking of the flux tube."

We examine the time evolution of the concurrence of the eigenstates of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and show that, for both initially separable and initially entangled states, simple product measurements suffice to saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound when CoE = -QFI, while otherwise, in general, entangled measurements are required giving an operational significance to the points in time when CoE = -QFI."
The relativity of color perception,"Michel Berthier, Valerie Garcin, Nicoletta Prencipe, Edoardo Provenzi",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13720v1,"Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a visual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by neurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of photoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile trichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or experimental assumption."
Landscape of Quantum Information Science and Engineering Education: From Physics Foundations to Interdisciplinary Frontiers,"A. R. Piña, Shams El-Adawy, Mike Verostek, Brett T.

Although QISE education still has a strong presence and roots in physics, the field is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. There is a need to understand the presence of QISE instruction and quantum-related instruction across all disciplines in order to figure out where QISE education is already happening and where it could be expanded. Although there is recent work that characterizes introductory QISE courses, there is no holistic picture of the landscape of QISE and quantum-related education in the United States. We analyzed course catalogs from 1,456 U.S. institutions. We found 61 institutions offering QISE degree programs, mostly at PhD-granting schools, with physics, electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and computer science(CS) as their primary contributors . Across all institutions, we identified over 8,000 courses mentioning 'quantum,' but about one-third of institutions in our study had none. We also found over 500 dedicated QISE courses, concentrated in PhD-granting institutions, primarily in physics, ECE, and CS. Physics leads in offering both general quantum-related ($\sim$4,700) and QISE-specific ($\sim$200) courses. Across multiple disciplines, we see that QISE topics are being introduced in courses not fully dedicated to QISE, which may be a productive strategy for increasing access to QISE education. Our dataset and analysis provide the most comprehensive overview to date of quantum education across US higher education. To ensure broad access, all data are publicly available and downloadable at quantumlandscape.streamlit.app. We hope these findings will support and guide future efforts in curriculum design, workforce development, and education policy across the quantum ecosystem."
Fast microwave-driven two-qubit gates between fluxonium qubits with a transmon coupler,"Siddharth Singh, Eugene Y. Huang, Jinlun Hu, Figen Yilmaz, Martijn F. S.

Using superconducting circuits, two-qubit gates have previously been implemented in different ways with each method aiming to maximize gate fidelity. Another important goal of a new gate scheme is to minimize the complexity of gate calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a high-fidelity two-qubit gate between two fluxonium qubits enabled by an intermediate capacitively coupled transmon. The coupling strengths between the qubits and the coupler are designed to minimize residual crosstalk while still allowing for fast gate operations. The gate is based on frequency selectively exciting the coupler using a microwave drive to complete a 2$\pi$ rotation, conditional on the state of the fluxonium qubits. When successful, this drive scheme implements a conditional phase gate. Using analytically derived pulse shapes, we minimize unwanted excitations of the coupler and obtain gate errors of $10^{-2}$ for gate times below 60~ns. At longer durations, our gate is limited by relaxation of the coupler. Our results show how carefully designed control pulses can speed up frequency selective entangling gates."
Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces,"Tobias Fritz, Antonio Lorenzin",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13708v1,"Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art."

When displaced from the rf null, the ion is superimposed by fast oscillations known as micromotion, which can be probed through motion-sensitive light-atom interactions. In this work, we report on the emergence of the rf pseudo-null, a locus of points where the ion responds to light as if it were at the true rf null, despite being displaced from it. The phenomenon is fully explained by accounting for the general two-dimensional structure of micromotion and is experimentally verified under various potential configurations, with observations in great agreement with numerical simulations. The rf pseudo-null manifests as a line in a two-dimensional parameter space, determined by the geometry of the incident light and its overlap with the motional structure of the ion.

Bassler,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13646v1,"Dicke superradiance describes an ensemble of $N$ permutationally invariant two-level systems collectively emitting radiation with a peak radiated intensity scaling as $N^2$. Although individual Dicke states are typically entangled, the density matrix during superradiant decay is a mixture of such states, raising the subtle question of whether the total state is entangled or separable. We resolve this by showing analytically that for all $N$, starting from the fully excited state, the collective decay preserves separability for all times. This answers a longstanding question on the role of entanglement in Dicke superradiance and underscores that, despite collective dissipation, separable states remain separable under these dynamics."
Realizing exceptional points by Floquet dissipative couplings in thermal atoms,"Zimo Zhang, Fengbo Zhang, Zhongxiao Xu, Ying Hu, Han Bao, Heng Shen",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13616v1,"Exceptional degeneracies and generically complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems are at the heart of numerous phenomena absent in the Hermitian realm. Recently, it was suggested that Floquet dissipative coupling in the space-time domain may provide a novel mechanism to drive intriguing spectral topology with no static analogues, though its experimental investigation in quantum systems remains elusive. We demonstrate such Floquet dissipative coupling in an ensemble of thermal atoms interacting with two spatially separated optical beams, and observe an anomalous anti-parity-time symmetry phase transition at an exception point far from the phase-transition threshold of the static counterpart. Our protocol sets the stage for Floquet engineering of non-Hermitian topological spectra, and for engineering new quantum phases that cannot exist in static systems."
Speedup Chip Yield Analysis by Improved Quantum Bayesian Inference,"Zi-Ming Li, Zeji Li, Tie-Fu Li, Yu-xi Liu",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13613v1,"The semiconductor chip manufacturing process is complex and lengthy, and potential errors arise at every stage.

In this letter, we propose an improved quantum Bayesian inference to accelerate the identification of error patterns on wafer bin maps, thereby assisting in chip yield analysis. We outline the algorithm for error identification and detail the implementation of improved quantum Bayesian inference.

Adaptive Lattice Gas Algorithm: Classical and Quantum implementations,"Niccolò Fonio, Ljubomir Budinski, Valtteri Lahtinen, Pierre Sagaut",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13549v1,"Lattice gas algorithms (LGA) are a class of algorithms including, in chronological order, binary lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), integer lattice gas algorithms (ILGA) and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).

These fractions are then adapted to reproduce LBM equilibrium distributions, resulting in an adaptive lattice gas algorithm (ALGA) that achieves the same simulation results of LBM. Considering this, we develop a quantum algorithm that involves a linear collision operator and capable of simulating the same phenomena, while still using a measurement and reinitialization procedure."
Quantum Walks-Based Adaptive Distribution Generation with Efficient CUDA-Q Acceleration,"Yen-Jui Chang, Wei-Ting Wang, Chen-Yu Liu, Yun-Yuan Wang, Ching-Ray Chang",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13532v1,"We present a novel Adaptive Distribution Generator that leverages a quantum walks-based approach to generate high precision and efficiency of target probability distributions.

Logical channel for heralded and pure loss with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code,"Tom B. Harris, Takaya Matsuura, Ben Q. Baragiola, Nicolas C. Menicucci",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13497v1,"Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for ""heralded loss,"" when some loss mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production."
Simulating Nonlinearity in Quantum Neural Networks While Mitigating Barren Plateaus,Ding-Dang Yang,2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13980v1,"Quantum neural networks (QNNs) encounter significant challenges in realizing nonlinear behavior and effectively optimizing parameters.

This design substantially reduces quantum circuit depth compared to conventional methods that rely on parameterized quantum gates, thereby mitigating the barren plateau problem. A QNN was implemented and tested on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets to evaluate the proposed method, achieving test accuracies of 98.7% and 88.3%, respectively.

However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology."

Utilizing this method, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for certain states to violate the parity-CHSH inequality. Building upon our proposal, the relationship between the noise parameter and the certifiable randomness in a bipartite entangled state is probed. Furthermore, we derive a monogamy relationship between the average values of the parity-CHSH inequality associated with the reduced three-qubit density matrices of GHZ-class states comprising four qubits."

This opens up possibilities for large-scale numerical simulations of collective decay processes."
Ultrabroad resonance of localized plasmon on a nanoparticle coupled with surface plasmon on a nanowire enabling two-photon excited emission via continuous-wave laser,"Tamitake Itoh, Yuko S. Yamamoto",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13417v1,"This study found that plasmonic hotspots (HSs) between silver nanoparticles (NPs) and silver nanowires (NWs) generated two-photon excited emissions, including hyper-Rayleigh, hyper-Raman, and two-photon fluorescence of dye molecules with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation. A comparison between experimental results and electromagnetic (EM) calculations revealed that a large EM enhancement factor (FR) at the HS appears in the visible to NIR regions owing to EM coupling between localized plasmons of the NP and surface plasmons of the NW. This ultrabroad resonance of the coupled plasmons enables the observation of two-photon-excited emissions with CW laser excitation. A comparison of the dependence of the NP diameter, NW diameter, and gap distance on two-photon-excited emissions further demonstrated that the large HS-by-HS variations in the emission intensities were mainly induced by the sensitivity of FR to the gap distance at the HSs. We also experimentally and theoretically investigated the propagation of two-photon-excited emission light to a neighboring NP on the NW via surface plasmons."
Adaptive Non-local Observable on Quantum Neural Networks,"Hsin-Yi Lin, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Shinjae Yoo",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13414v1,"Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.   Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network."
Quantum repeaters enhanced by vacuum beam guides,"Yu Gan, Mohadeseh Azar, Nitish Kumar Chandra, Xin Jin, Jinglei Cheng, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan, Junyu Liu",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13397v1,"The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities."
Logical channels in approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill error correction,"Mahnaz Jafarzadeh, Jonathan Conrad, Rafael N. Alexander, Ben Q. Baragiola",2025-04-18,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13383v1,"The GKP encoding is a top contender among bosonic codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Analysis of the GKP code is complicated by the fact that finite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not orthogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit using damped, approximate GKP states that virtually project onto the ideal GKP code space between rounds of error correction even when finite-energy GKP states are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors; however, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely positive, trace-preserving channels on the logical code space. We present two solutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The first twirls over the full stabilizer group motivated by standard binning (SB) decoding that converts small amounts of damping into Gaussian random noise. The second twirls over a set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy in the code finite and allow for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not limited to small damping, can be applied when logical GKP unitaries or other sources of CV noise are present, and allows us to study general decoding, which can be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare decoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While our results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP states, the advantage of optimized decoding over SB decoding shrinks as the energy in the code increases, and moreover the performance of both strategies converges to that of the stabilizer-twirled logical channel. These studies provide stronger arguments for commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP error correction:(i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of coherently damped ones, and(ii) the use of SB decoding."
Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance,"Aitor Gómez-Tejedor, Eneko Osaba, Esther Villar-Rodriguez",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13376v1,"This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique, assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario."
"Optimized Clifford Noise Reduction: Theory, Simulations and Experiments","Edwin Tham, Nicolas Delfosse",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13356v1,"We propose several optimizations of the CliNR partial error correction scheme which implements Clifford circuits by consuming a resource state. Errors are corrected by measuring a sequence of Pauli operators that we refer to as the verification sequence. We first propose a global optimization algorithm searching for a verification sequence resulting in a low logical error rate using tabu search. Then, we introduce a proxy for the logical error rate which is easier to evaluate and we design a two-step optimization algorithm. First, a verification sequence minimizing the proxy is computed, then this sequence is refined by reintroducing the logical error rate. Finally, we identify a large group of automorphisms of the search space which preserve the proxy and we use this symmetry to reduce the size of the search space. This results in a 168 $\times$ (respectively 20,160 $\times$) reduction of the size of the search space for the optimization of verification sequences with three (respectively four) Pauli operators. Our numerical simulations for 20-qubit Clifford circuits with size 400 under the ion chain model show that our optimization algorithms improve the performance of CliNR by 25% and that the two-step optimization achieves the same results as the global optimization with 64% fewer evaluations of the logical error rate. Finally, we perform experiments on a 36-qubit trapped ion quantum computer, without mid-circuit measurements, showing that the CZNR variant of CliNR is at breakeven."

We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems."

Theory of quantum optics and optical coherence in high harmonic generation,"Philipp Stammer, Javier Rivera-Dean, Maciej Lewenstein",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13287v1,"Optical coherence encodes information about the correlations of the electromagnetic field. In combination with quantum optical approaches, it allows for the study of the correlations between photons. Since the pioneering papers of Glauber, studies of optical coherence have facilitated many fundamental insights into non-classical signatures of light emission processes, with wide applicability in modern quantum technologies. However, when it comes to the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the description has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we overcome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field correlations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we introduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics and strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field correlation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties of the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we develop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic field, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study the correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in atomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the correlations. Since the theory is generic, it can be extended to multi-time correlation functions of any order, and allows to consider the interaction of light with arbitrary material systems."

High-Precision Phase Control of an Optical Lattice with up to 50 dB Noise Suppression,"Kendall Mehling, Murray Holland, Catie LeDesma",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13264v1,"An optical lattice is a periodic light crystal constructed from the standing-wave interference patterns of laser beams. It can be used to store and manipulate quantum degenerate atoms and is an ideal platform for the quantum simulation of many-body physics. A principal feature is that optical lattices are flexible and possess a variety of multidimensional geometries with modifiable band-structure. An even richer landscape emerges when control functions can be applied to the lattice by modulating the position or amplitude with Floquet driving. However, the desire for realizing high-modulation bandwidths while preserving extreme lattice stability has been difficult to achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective solution that consists of overlapping two counterpropagating lattice beams and controlling the phase and intensity of each with independent acousto-optic modulators. Our phase controller mixes sampled light from both lattice beams with a common optical reference. This dual heterodyne locking method allows exquisite determination of the lattice position, while also removing parasitic phase noise accrued as the beams travel along separate paths. We report up to 50dB suppression in lattice phase noise in the 0.1Hz - 1Hz band along with significant suppression spanning more than four decades of frequency. When integrated, the absolute phase diffusion of the lattice position is only 10\r{A} over 10 s. This method permits precise, high-bandwidth modulation (above 50kHz) of the optical lattice intensity and phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by executing intricate time-varying phase profiles for atom interferometry."

After recognizing quantum signatures of resonances in the Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we reveal a differentiated sensitivity to the perturbation of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, depending on whether the states satisfy a resonant condition or not. It is also shown that this differentiated sensitivity becomes more pronounced as the system size increases, leading to the KAM theorem in the classical limit $J\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical and analytical results obtained from unitary perturbation theory strongly support these findings. Although specific to kicked models, our results can be easily extended to more general scenarios, allowing the identification of the quantum mechanism that corresponds to the KAM theorem in the classical limit."

To create a large spatial superposition with nanoparticles, we envisage embedding a spin in a nanoparticle as a defect and applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field as in a Stern-Gerlach type experiment to create a macroscopic quantum superposition. Such matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, adjacent matter-wave interferometers can use entanglement features to test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a lab. In particular, we will use white and flicker noise to study the decoherence and constrain the parameters keeping in mind ambient temperatures suitable for superconducting wires embedded on a chip. We will show that to obtain a tiny spatial superposition of a nanometer separation, $\Delta x \sim {\cal O} (10^{-9})$m and to minimize decoherence, $\Gamma\leq {\cal O}(\frac{\omega_0}{2\pi})$, where $\Gamma$ is the decoherence and $\omega_0$ is the frequency of the oscillator, we will need current fluctuations to be $\delta I/I\leq {\cal O}(10^{-8})$, which is not impossible to obtain in superconducting wire arrangements.

We emphasize that the error scales as $ \epsilon = O(\kappa T / R^c) $ with $c \geq 1$, indicating that the required $R$ decreases significantly with increasing $c$ to achieve a desired error.

We reach unprecedented yoctojoule-level sensitivity and a dynamic range exceeding 90 decibels. We utilize this capability to measure time-dependent intrapulse light coherence - a regime inaccessible to conventional, time-averaged spectroscopy. This opens new avenues for quantum information, cryptography, and quantum light-matter interactions on sub-cycle time scales with attosecond precision."
Tunable Entangling and Steering of Ferrimagnetic Magnons via an OptoMagnoMechanical Ring,"Ziyad Imara, Isaac Pérez Castillo, Khadija El Anouz, Abderahim El Allati",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13117v1,"Recently, magnomechanical systems have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies, exploiting magnon-photon-phonon interactions to store high-fidelity quantum information. In this paper, we propose a scheme to entangle two spatially separated ferrimagnetic YIG crystals by injecting a microwave field into an optomagnonic ring cavity. The proposed optomagnomechanical configuration utilizes the coupling between magnetostriction-induced mechanical displacements and the optical cavity via radiation pressure. Magnons - collective spin excitations in macroscopic ferromagnets - are directly driven by an electromagnetic field. We demonstrate the generation of macroscopic magnon entanglement by exciting the optical cavity with a red detuned microwave field and the YIG crystals with a blue detuned field. Our analysis reveals that magnon entanglement vanishes for identical magnomechanical couplings but remains robust against thermal fluctuations. The magnon modes entangled in two ferrimagnetic crystals represent genuine macroscopic quantum states with potential applications in the study of macroscopic quantum mechanics and quantum information processing based on magnonics. The configuration is based on experimentally accessible parameters, providing a feasible route of quantum technologies."

"Energy Landscape Plummeting in Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Subspace Optimization, Non-iterative Corrections and Generator-informed Initialization for Improved Quantum Efficiency","Chayan Patra, Rahul Maitra",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13097v1,"Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) faces significant challenges due to hardware noise and the presence of barren plateaus and local traps in the optimization landscape. To mitigate the detrimental effects of these issues, we introduce a general formalism that optimizes hardware resource utilization and accuracy by projecting VQE optimizations on to a reduced-dimensional subspace, followed by a set of posteriori corrections. Our method partitions the ansatz into a lower dimensional principal subspace and a higher-dimensional auxiliary subspace based on a conjecture of temporal hierarchy present among the parameters during optimization. The adiabatic approximation exploits this hierarchy, restricting optimization to the lower dimensional principal subspace only. This is followed by an efficient higher dimensional auxiliary space reconstruction without the need to perform variational optimization. These reconstructed auxiliary parameters are subsequently included in the cost-function via a set of auxiliary subspace corrections (ASC) leading to a ""plummeting effect"" in the energy landscape toward a more optimal minima without utilizing any additional quantum hardware resources. Numerical simulations show that, when integrated with any chemistry-inspired ansatz, our method can provide one to two orders of magnitude better estimation of the minima. Additionally, based on the adiabatic approximation, we introduce a novel initialization strategy driven by unitary rotation generators for accelerated convergence of gradient-informed dynamic quantum algorithms. Our method shows heuristic evidences of alleviating the effects of local traps, facilitating convergence toward a more optimal minimum."

We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the context of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit Edwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an intricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in a distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt echo, an experimentally accessible quantity.In general, phenomena familiar from single-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body incarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich ensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators. The variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous typology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their many-body counterparts."
Feedforward suppression of readout-induced faults in quantum error correction,"Liran Shirizly, Dekel Meirom, Malcolm Carroll, Haggai Landa",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13083v1,"We propose a method to reduce readout-induced faults, applicable in settings like quantum error correction with repeated measurement cycles.

For readout errors and measurement-induced leakage that are stronger in a particular qubit state, this feedforward protocol can suppress the physical qubit errors. Focusing on a simple realization of conditionally flipping (by an X gate) the state of check qubits before their measurement, we investigate the effect of such state-dependent errors using simulations in the setup of a low-density parity check code. We show that the suggested protocol can reduce both logical errors and decoding time, two important aspects of fault-tolerant quantum computations."

A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation."

Observation of quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons,"Jan-Wilke Henke, Hao Jeng, Murat Sivis, Claus Ropers",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13047v1,"Quantum entanglement is central to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and the development of new technologies in information processing, communication, and sensing. Entanglement has been realised in a variety of physical systems, spanning atoms, ions, photons, collective excitations, and hybrid combinations of particles. Remarkably, however, photons and free electrons -- the quanta of light and their most elementary sources -- have never been observed in an entangled state. Here, we demonstrate quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons. We show that entanglement is produced when an electron, prepared in a superposition of two beams, passes a nanostructure and generates transition radiation in a polarisation state tied to the electron path. By implementing quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the full density matrix of the electron-photon pair, and show that the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is violated by more than 7 standard deviations. Based on this foundational element of emerging free-electron quantum optics, we anticipate manifold developments in enhanced electron imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. More broadly, the ability to generate and measure entanglement opens electron microscopy to previously inaccessible quantum observables and correlations in solids and nanostructures."
Machine Learning Decoding of Circuit-Level Noise for Bivariate Bicycle Codes,"John Blue, Harshil Avlani, Zhiyang He, Liu Ziyin, Isaac L. Chuang",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13043v1,"Fault-tolerant quantum computers will depend crucially on the performance of the classical decoding algorithm which takes in the results of measurements and outputs corrections to the errors inferred to have occurred. Machine learning models have shown great promise as decoders for the surface code; however, this promise has not yet been substantiated for the more challenging task of decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. In this paper, we present a recurrent, transformer-based neural network designed to decode circuit-level noise on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes, introduced recently by Bravyi et al (Nature 627, 778-782, 2024). For the $[[72,12,6]]$ BB code, at a physical error rate of $p=0.1\%$, our model achieves a logical error rate almost $5$ times lower than belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD). Moreover, while BP-OSD has a wide distribution of runtimes with significant outliers, our model has a consistent runtime and is an order-of-magnitude faster than the worst-case times from a benchmark BP-OSD implementation. On the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, our model obtains worse logical error rates but maintains the speed advantage. These results demonstrate that machine learning decoders can out-perform conventional decoders on QLDPC codes, in regimes of current interest."

They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved, reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior."
Practical Application of the Quantum Carleman Lattice Boltzmann Method in Industrial CFD Simulations,"Francesco Turro, Alessandra Lignarolo, Daniele Dragoni",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13033v1,"Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations are crucial in industrial applications but require extensive computational resources, particularly for extreme turbulent regimes. While classical digital approaches remain the standard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more efficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.   This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion and solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions, periodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on high-performance computing resources.   Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error fidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for practical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small lattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway to mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation."
Three-dimensional canonical quantum plasmonics for finite media: exact solution in terms of the classical Green tensor,"Georgii Semin, Hans-Rudolf Jauslin, Stephane Guerin",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13029v1,"This article presents a comprehensive three-dimensional canonical quantization to treat quantum plasmonics for finite metallic or dielectric media of arbitrary shape. We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and dispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by the fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one obtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a Hamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators characterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized by the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in a bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, like, e.g., the electric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an infinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field operator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation operators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type. We show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the classical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission of an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of some terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local density of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the literature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small dissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a justification of this approach."

Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles"". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes."

Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination,"Theshani Nuradha, Mark M.

In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels."

Computing $n$-time correlation functions without ancilla qubits,"Xiaoyang Wang, Long Xiong, Xiaoxia Cai, Xiao Yuan",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12975v1,"The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure fermionic and bosonic single-particle spectra of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Schwinger model, respectively, and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the experiment, we further introduce a signal-processing strategy that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise."
Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy of individual nuclear spins in a dense bath,"Alexander Ulanowski, Olivier Kuijpers, Benjamin Merkel, Adrian Holzäpfel, Andreas Reiserer",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12957v1,"Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids."
A resource theory of asynchronous quantum information processing,"Chloe Kim, Eric Chitambar, Felix Leditzky",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12945v1,"In standard quantum teleportation, the receiver must wait for a classical message from the sender before subsequently processing the transmitted quantum information. However, in port-based teleportation (PBT), this local processing can begin before the classical message is received, thereby allowing for asynchronous quantum information processing. Motivated by resource-theoretic considerations and practical applications, we propose different communication models that progressively allow for more powerful decoding strategies while still permitting asynchronous distributed quantum computation, a salient feature of standard PBT. Specifically, we consider PBT protocols augmented by free classical processing and/or different forms of quantum pre-processing, and we investigate the maximum achievable teleportation fidelities under such operations. Our analysis focuses specifically on the PBT power of isotropic states, bipartite graph states, and symmetrized EPR states, and we compute tight bounds on the optimal teleportation fidelities for such states. We finally show that, among this hierarchy of communication models consistent with asynchronous quantum information processing, the strongest resource theory is equally as powerful as any one-way teleportation protocol for surpassing the classical teleportation threshold. Thus, a bipartite state can break the one-way classical teleportation threshold if and only if it can be done using the trivial decoding map of discarding subsystems."

For braided GSAs, this setup enables decoherence-free transfer and swapping of their internal entangled states. For separate GSAs, engineering coupling phases leads to state-dependent chiral emission, which enables selective, directional quantum information transfer. This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class entangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum networks and quantum information processing."
Performance guarantees of light-cone variational quantum algorithms for the maximum cut problem,"Xiaoyang Wang, Yuexin Su, Tongyang Li",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12896v1,"Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising to demonstrate the advantage of near-term quantum computing over classical computing in practical applications, such as the maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. However, current VQAs such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower performance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and suffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We propose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard VQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while avoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone VQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut problem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of the 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation procedure. Finally, these performance guarantees are verified by numerical simulations and hardware demonstrations on IBM quantum devices. In a 72-qubit demonstration, the single-round light-cone VQA achieves the exact MaxCut solution whereas the $p$-round QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ only obtains approximate solutions. Furthermore, the single-round light-cone VQA derives solutions surpassing the hardness threshold in a 148-qubit demonstration while QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ does not. Our work highlights a promising route towards solving practical and classically hard problems on near-term quantum devices."

In this work, we extend the scope to address quantum advantage in tasks relevant to chemistry and physics. Specifically, we consider the unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz-a variant of the unitary coupled cluster ansatz, which is widely used to solve the electronic structure problem on quantum computers-to show that sampling from the output distributions of quantum circuits implementing the UCJ ansatz is likely to be classically hard. More specifically, we show that there exist UCJ circuits for which classical simulation of sampling cannot be performed in polynomial time, under a reasonable complexity-theoretical assumption that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse. Our main contribution is to show that a class of UCJ circuits can be used to perform arbitrary instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) computations, which are already known to be classically hard to simulate under the same complexity assumption. As a side result, we also show that UCJ equipped with post-selection can generate the class post-BQP. Our demonstration, worst-case nonsimulatability of UCJ, would potentially imply quantum advantage in quantum algorithms for chemistry and physics using unitary coupled cluster type ansatzes, such as the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum-selected configuration interaction."
Unbiased Quantum Error Mitigation Without Reliance on an Accurate Error Model,"Haipeng Xie, Nobuyuki Yoshioka, Kento Tsubouchi, Ying Li",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12864v1,"Probabilistic error cancellation is a quantum error mitigation technique capable of producing unbiased computation results but requires an accurate error model. Constructing this model involves estimating a set of parameters, which, in the worst case, may scale exponentially with the number of qubits. In this paper, we introduce a method called spacetime noise inversion, revealing that unbiased quantum error mitigation can be achieved with just a single accurately measured error parameter and a sampler of Pauli errors. The error sampler can be efficiently implemented in conjunction with quantum error correction. We provide rigorous analyses of bias and cost, showing that the cost of measuring the parameter and sampling errors is low -- comparable to the cost of the computation itself. Moreover, our method is robust to the fluctuation of error parameters, a limitation of unbiased quantum error mitigation in practice. These findings highlight the potential of integrating quantum error mitigation with error correction as a promising approach to suppress computational errors in the early fault-tolerant era."
Long-wavelength optical lattices from optical beatnotes: theory and applications,"Tommaso Petrucciani, Andrea Santoni, Chiara Mazzinghi, Dimitrios Trypogeorgos, Francesco Minardi, Marco Fattori, Michele Modugno",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12831v1,"We present a theoretical analysis of Beat-Note Superlattices (BNSLs), a recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed, generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer significant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in quantum technologies."
Learning Time-Varying Quantum Lossy Channels,"Angela Rosy Morgillo, Stefano Mancini, Massimiliano F. Sacchi, Chiara Macchiavello",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12810v1,"Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties. Here, we consider Gaussian lossy channels varying from one use to another and we employ neural networks to classify, regress, and forecast the behavior of these channels from their Choi-Jamiolkowski states. The networks achieve at least 87% of accuracy in distinguishing between non-Markovian, Markovian, memoryless, compound, and deterministic channels. In regression tasks, the model accurately reconstructs the loss parameter sequences, and in forecasting, it predicts future values, with improved performance as the memory parameter approaches 1 for Markovian channels. These results demonstrate the potential of neural networks in characterizing and predicting the dynamics of quantum channels."
A tight consecutive measurement theorem and its applications,"Chen-Xun Weng, Minglong Qin, Yanglin Hu, Marco Tomamichel",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12754v1,"In many cryptographic tasks, we encounter scenarios where information about two incompatible observables must be retrieved. A natural approach is to perform consecutive measurements, raising a key question: How does the information gained from the first measurement compare to that from both? The consecutive measurement theorem provides a general relation between these quantities and has been used in quantum proofs of knowledge and nonlocal games. However, its previous formulations are often too loose to yield meaningful bounds, especially in quantum nonlocal games. Here, we establish a tight version of the theorem and apply it to improve the best-known bounds on the quantum value of $\text{CHSH}_q(p)$ games and their parallel repetition. We also present a novel application of the theorem to obtain a tighter trade-offs bound in quantum oblivious transfer for certain regimes. These results enhance the theoretical tools for analyzing quantum advantage and have concrete implications for nonlocal games and quantum cryptographic protocols."
Macroscopic states and operations: a generalized resource theory of coherence,"Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12738v1,"To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we focus on the concept of macroscopic states, i.e. coarse representations of microscopic details, defined as states that can be inferred solely from the outcomes of macroscopic measurements. Building on the theories of quantum statistical sufficiency and quantum Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through several equivalent formulations, ranging from algebraic to explicitly constructive. We introduce a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-decreasing operations and develop a resource theory of microscopicity that unifies and generalizes existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, purity, and asymmetry. Finally, we introduce the concept of inferential reference frames and reinterpret macroscopic entropy as a measure of inferential asymmetry, i.e., irretrodictability."
Dead Gate Elimination,"Yanbin Chen, Christian B. Mendl, Helmut Seidl",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12729v1,"Hybrid quantum algorithms combine the strengths of quantum and classical computing. Many quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), leverage this synergy. However, quantum circuits are executed in full, even when only subsets of measurement outcomes contribute to subsequent classical computations. In this manuscript, we propose a novel circuit optimization technique that identifies and removes dead gates. We prove that the removal of dead gates has no influence on the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes that contribute to the subsequent calculation result. We implemented and evaluated our optimization on a VQE instance, a quantum phase estimation (QPE) instance, and hybrid programs embedded with random circuits of varying circuit width, confirming its capability to remove a non-trivial number of dead gates in real-world algorithms. The effect of our optimization scales up as more measurement outcomes are identified as non-contributory, resulting in a proportionally greater reduction of dead gates."
Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations,"Niklas Göllmann, Matthew R. Ludwig, Peter Wind, Laura Ratcliff, Luca Frediani",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12726v1,"We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules, which is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the core-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional Theory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the $\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show that our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which made use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding Atomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision compared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials calculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to target molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell methods have been implemented."
Quantum circuit synthesis with qudit phase gadget method,"Shuai Yang, Lihao Xu, Guojing Tian, Xiaoming Sun",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12710v1,"Current quantum devices have unutilized high-level quantum resources. More and more attention has been paid to the qudit quantum systems with larger than two dimensions to maximize the potential computing power of quantum computation. Then, a natural problem arises: How do we implement quantum algorithms on qudit quantum systems? In this work, we propose a novel qudit phase gadget method for synthesizing the qudit diagonal unitary matrices. This method is suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) and fault-tolerant eras due to its versatility in different connectivity architectures and the optimality of its resource consumption. The method can work on any connectivity architecture with asymptotic optimal circuit depth and size. For a 10-qutrit diagonal unitary, our algorithm reduces the circuit depth form about 100000 to 500 with 300 ancillary qutrits. Further, this method can be promoted to different quantum circuit synthesis problems, such as quantum state preparation problems, general unitary synthesis problems, etc."
Excitation transfer and many-body dark states in WQED,"Wei Chen, Guin-Dar Lin, H. H. Jen",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12677v1,"In one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, quantum emitters interact through infinite-range, dispersive, and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions mediated by guided photonic modes. These interactions give rise to long-range periodic behavior and rich many-body physics absent in free space. In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized M-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their time-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of excitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark states and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation transfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction of $N_\text{p}/N \approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the robustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including positional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight the role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy transfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in integrated quantum platforms."
Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving accelerated detectors?,"Dipankar Barman, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674v1,"Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime."
Enantiospecific Two-Photon Electric-Dipole Selection Rules of Chiral Molecules,"Fen Zou, Yong Li, Peng Zhang",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12648v1,"Distinguishing between enantiomers is crucial in the study of chiral molecules in chemistry and pharmacology. Many optical approaches rely on enantiospecific cyclic electric-dipole transitions induced by three microwave or laser beams. However, these approaches impose stringent requirements, including phase locking, three-photon resonance, and precise control over beam intensities and operation times, which enhance the complexity and restrict the applicability. In this letter, we present a novel optical method that {\it eliminates these constraints entirely.} Specifically, we demonstrate that in the presence of a static electric field, the selection rules for two-photon electric-dipole transitions differ between enantiomers. This distinction arises because the static electric field breaks the symmetry associated with the combined action of a specific rotation and time-reversal transformation. Leveraging the enantiospecific two-photon selection rule, one can selectively excite a desired enantiomer using only two beams, without the need for phase locking, resonance condition, and the precise control of their intensities and operation times. Our method significantly enhances the feasibility and applicability of optical approaches for enantiomer differentiation."
Transferring linearly fixed QAOA angles: performance and real device results,"Ryo Sakai, Hiromichi Matsuyama, Wai-Hong Tam, Yu Yamashiro",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12632v1,"Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) enables solving combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers by optimizing variational parameters for quantum circuits. We investigate a simplified approach that combines linear parameterization with parameter transferring, reducing the parameter space to just 4 dimensions regardless of the number of layers. This simplification draws inspiration from quantum annealing schedules providing both theoretical grounding and practical advantages. We compare this combined approach with standard QAOA and other parameter setting strategies such as INTERP and FOURIER, which require computationally demanding incremental layer-by-layer optimization. Notably, previously known methods like INTERP and FOURIER yield parameters that can be well fitted by linear functions, which supports our linearization strategy. Our analysis reveals that for the random Ising model, cost landscapes in this reduced parameter space demonstrate consistent structural patterns across different problem instances. Our experiments extend from classical simulation to actual quantum hardware implementation on IBM's Eagle processor, demonstrating the approach's viability on current NISQ devices. Furthermore, the numerical results indicate that parameter transferability primarily depends on the energy scale of problem instances, with normalization techniques improving transfer quality. Most of our numerical experiments are conducted on the random Ising model, while problem-dependence is also investigated across other models. A key advantage of parameter transferring is the complete elimination of instance-specific classical optimization overhead, as pre-trained parameters can be directly applied to other problem instances, reducing classical optimization costs by orders of magnitude for deeper circuits."
Sampling-based Quantum Optimization Algorithm with Quantum Relaxation,"Hiromichi Matsuyama, Yu Yamashiro",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12629v1,"Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) is a hybrid algorithm for noisy quantum devices. However, statistical fluctuations and physical noise degrade the solution quality, so it is difficult to maintain applicability for large-scale problems. In contrast, Sampling-based Quantum Algorithms have recently been successfully applied to large-scale quantum chemistry problems. The quantum device is used only for sampling, and the ground state and its energy are estimated on the classical device. In this study, we propose the Sampling-based Quantum Optimization Algorithm (SQOA). Two challenges exist in constructing a Sampling-based Quantum Algorithm for combinatorial optimization. The first challenge is that we need to encode the optimization problem in a non-diagonal Hamiltonian, even though many VQAs encode it into the Ising Hamiltonian, which is diagonal. The second challenge is that we need a method to prepare the input state to be sampled efficiently. We employ the Quantum Relaxation (QR) method for the first challenge, which encodes multiple classical variables in one qubit. It reduces required qubits compared to the Ising Hamiltonian approach. Moreover, we investigate the parameter transferability in the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for QR Hamiltonians for the second challenge. We show that restricting parameters to a linear form exhibits moderate transferability for 3-regular MaxCut problems, similar to transferability observed in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. This property allows us to efficiently prepare the input state for a large instance using the parameters from a small instance. We leveraged transferability to create input states and applied SQOA with QR to the MaxCut instances. Transferring parameters from a 20-node problem demonstrates that SQOA with QR provides high-quality solutions for 40-node problems without variational parameter optimization."
Enhancing NDAR with Delay-Gate-Induced Amplitude Damping,"Wai-Hong Tam, Hiromichi Matsuyama, Ryo Sakai, Yu Yamashiro",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12628v1,"The Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping (NDAR) method utilizes amplitude damping noise to enhance the performance of quantum optimization algorithms. NDAR alternates between exploration by sampling solutions from the quantum circuit and exploitation by transforming the cost Hamiltonian by changing the signs of its terms. Both exploration and exploitation are important components in classical heuristic algorithm design. In this study, we examine how NDAR performance improves by adjusting the balance between these components. We control the degree of exploitation by varying the delay time to 0, 50, and $100~\mu\text{s}$, and investigate exploration strategies using two quantum circuits, QAOA and a random circuit, on IBM's Heron processor. Our results show that increasing delay time in NDAR improves the best objective value found in each iteration. In single-layer QAOA and random circuits applied to unweighted Max-Cut problem with low edge density, both exploration strategies yield similar objective value trajectories and provide competitive solution quality to simulated annealing for the 80-node problem. Their similar performance indicates that, in most cases, increasing amplitude damping noise via additional delay time results in information loss. On the other hand, QAOA outperforms random circuits in specific cases, such as positive-negative weighted Max-Cut on a fully connected graph. This suggests potential advantages of QAOA in more complex settings. We further develop a classical NDAR to better understand exploration strategies, demonstrating that controlling the Hamming weight distribution of sampled bitstrings yields higher quality solutions. This suggests that identifying suitable quantum circuits for exploration could enhance NDAR performance."
Implementing Slack-Free Custom Penalty Function for QUBO on Gate-Based Quantum Computers,"Xin Wei Lee, Hoong Chuin Lau",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12611v1,"Solving NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization problems using quantum algorithms remains a challenging yet promising avenue toward quantum advantage. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), typically require constrained problems to be reformulated as unconstrained ones using penalty methods.A common approach introduces slack variables and quadratic penalties in the QUBO formulation to handle inequality constraints. However, this leads to increased qubit requirements and often distorts the optimization landscape, making it harder to find high-quality feasible solutions. To address these issues, we explore a slack-free formulation that directly encodes inequality constraints using custom penalty functions, specifically the exponential function and the Heaviside step function. These step-like penalties suppress infeasible solutions without introducing additional qubits or requiring finely tuned weights. Inspired by recent developments in quantum annealing and threshold-based constraint handling in gate-based algorithms, we implement and evaluate our approach on the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). Experimental results show that the step-based formulation significantly improves feasibility and optimality rates compared to unbalanced penalization, while reducing overall qubit overhead."
Solving Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems with Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution,"Xin Wei Lee, Hoong Chuin Lau",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12607v1,"Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) has emerged as a promising research direction. Since the introduction of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), numerous variants have been proposed to enhance its performance. QAOA was later extended to the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+), which generalizes the initial state, phase-separation operator, and mixer to address constrained problems without relying on the standard Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation. However, QAOA+ often requires additional ancilla qubits and a large number of multi-controlled Toffoli gates to prepare the superposition of feasible states, resulting in deep circuits that are challenging for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, VQAs are generally hindered by issues such as barren plateaus and suboptimal local minima. Recently, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), a ground-state preparation algorithm, has been explored as an alternative to QAOA and its variants. QITE has demonstrated improved performance in quantum chemistry problems and has been applied to unconstrained combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. In this work, we apply the variational form of QITE (VarQITE) to solve the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), a constrained problem, using a Max-Cut-tailored ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address constrained optimization using VarQITE. We show that VarQITE achieves significantly lower mean optimality gaps compared to QAOA and other conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that scaling the Hamiltonian coefficients can further reduce optimization costs and accelerate convergence."

Our approach employs an adapted version of the Szegedy quantum walk model (adapted SzQW), which takes place on bipartite graphs, and an adapted version of Staggered Quantum Walks (Adapted StQW), which takes place on 2-tessellable graphs, with the goal of efficiently finding a marked vertex by querying an oracle. The Ambainis, Gily\'en, Jeffery, and Kokainis' algorithm (AGJK), which provides a quadratic speedup on balanced bipartite graphs, is used as a subroutine in our algorithm.

Our featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression. Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits."
Enhancing Quantum Dense Coding Robustness Using Information Entropy-Based Metrics,"Syed Emad Uddin Shubha, Tasnuva Farheen",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12565v1,"Superdense Coding is a cornerstone in secure quantum communication, exploiting pre-shared entanglement to encode two classical bits within a single qubit. However, noise and decoherence deteriorate entanglement quality, restricting both fidelity and channel capacity in practical settings. Traditional methods, such as error correcting codes or entanglement distillation, are generally inadequate for dynamically varying noise conditions. Moreover, reliance on fidelity alone may fail to capture more subtle noise effects. This work introduces an adaptive protocol that integrates the five-qubit perfect code with a novel global adaptive purification that avoids discarding entangled pairs. By monitoring two information entropy-based metrics, quantum discord (QD) and entanglement of formation (EoF) from pilot pairs, we dynamically tune a global unitary to counteract noise. Our simulations, under both amplitude and phase damping, indicate that this integrated strategy could significantly enhance superdense coding robustness while preserving high throughput, thereby offering a scalable pathway toward a high-capacity quantum internet."
In-situ mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset in a single-species trapped-ion quantum computing system,"Yichao Yu, Keqin Yan, Debopriyo Biswas, Ni, Zhang, Bahaa Harraz, Crystal Noel, Christopher Monroe, Alexander Kozhanov",2025-04-17,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12544v1,"We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions.

We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture."

Multi-qubit nanoscale sensing with entanglement as a resource,"Jared Rovny, Shimon Kolkowitz, Nathalie P. de Leon",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12533v1,"Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using coherent, single qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to improve measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically unresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer length scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally resolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating the relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are both optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling protocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally, we demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers."

By randomly sampling quantum states, we analyze the distribution of magic for both pure and mixed states and compare the trace distance with other magic measures, as well as entanglement. Additionally, we classify Bell-like inequalities corresponding to the facets of the stabilizer polytope and establish a general concentration result connecting magic and entanglement via Fannes' inequality. Our findings provide new insights into the geometric structure of magic and its role in small-scale quantum systems, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum resources."

This question is particularly relevant to the feasibility of using solid-state-based systems in the search for the first experimental realization of quantum backflow, a quantum interference effect in which a particle's probability density flows in a direction opposite to its momentum."
Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism,"Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12485v1,"This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter can be described by means of two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each described by its own spectral density. Therefore, for initial thermal states of the reservoirs having different temperatures, the common approach based on the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object cannot be employed. We study the interaction of a quantum emitter with these two reservoirs introducing a temperature-dependent effective spectral density of the electromagnetic environment, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach."

However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos."
Coarsening of binary Bose superfluids: an effective theory,"Elisabeth Gliott, Clara Piekarski, Nicolas Cherroret",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12462v1,"We derive an effective equation of motion for binary Bose mixtures, which generalizes the Cahn-Hilliard description of classical binary fluids to superfluid systems. Within this approach, based on a microscopic Hamiltonian formulation, we show that the domain growth law $L(t)\sim t^{2/3}$ observed in superfluid mixtures is not driven by hydrodynamic flows, but arises from the competition between interactions and quantum pressure. The effective theory allows us to derive key properties of superfluid coarsening, including domain growth and Porod's laws. This provides a new theoretical framework for understanding phase separation in superfluid mixtures."
Layered KIK quantum error mitigation for dynamic circuits and error correction,"Ben Bar, Jader P. Santos, Raam Uzdin",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12457v1,"Quantum Error Mitigation is essential for enhancing the reliability of quantum computing experiments. The adaptive KIK error mitigation method has demonstrated significant advantages, including resilience to noise parameter time-drift, applicability to non-Clifford gates, and guaranteed performance bounds. However, its reliance on global noise amplification introduces limitations, such as incompatibility with mid-circuit measurements and dynamic circuits, as well as small unaccounted errors due to higher-order Magnus noise terms. In this work, we propose a layer-based noise amplification approach that overcomes these challenges without incurring additional overhead or experimental complexity. Since the layered KIK framework is inherently compatible with mid-circuit measurements, it enables seamless integration with error correction codes. This synergy allows error correction to address dominant noise mechanisms while the layered KIK suppresses residual errors arising from leakage and correlated noise sources."

The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design."
Constant-time hybrid compilation of Shor's algorithm with quantum just-in-time compilation,"David Ittah, Jackson Fraser, Josh Izaac, Olivia Di Matteo",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12449v1,"Continuous improvements in quantum computing hardware are exposing the need for simultaneous advances in software. Large-scale implementation of quantum algorithms requires rapid and automated compilation routines such as circuit synthesis and optimization. As systems move towards fault-tolerance, programming frameworks and compilers must also be capable of compiling and optimizing programs comprising both classical and quantum code. This work takes a step in that direction by providing an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm, compiled to elementary quantum gates using PennyLane and Catalyst, a library for quantum just-in-time (QJIT) compilation of hybrid workflows. We demonstrate that with QJIT compilation, the algorithm is compiled once per bit width of $N$, the integer being factored, even when $N$-specific optimizations are applied to circuit generation based on values determined at runtime. The implementation is benchmarked up to 32-bit $N$, and both the size of the compiled program and the pure compilation time are found to be constant (under 3 seconds on a laptop computer), meaning code generation becomes tractable even for realistic problem sizes."
Standardization of Multi-Objective QUBOs,"Loong Kuan Lee, Thore Thassilo Gerlach, Nico Piatkowski",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12419v1,"Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are scarce."
Quantum vs. classical: A comprehensive benchmark study for predicting time series with variational quantum machine learning,"Tobias Fellner, David Kreplin, Samuel Tovey, Christian Holm",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12416v1,"Variational quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed as promising tools for time series prediction, with the potential to handle complex sequential data more effectively than classical approaches.

We evaluate their predictive performance on three chaotic systems across 27 time series prediction tasks of varying complexity, and ensure a fair comparison through extensive hyperparameter optimization. Our results indicate that, in many cases, quantum models struggle to match the accuracy of simple classical counterparts of comparable complexity. Furthermore, we analyze the predictive performance relative to the model complexity and discuss the practical limitations of variational quantum algorithms for time series forecasting."

This practically inevitable scenario leads to a tripartite quantum system of matter, and light -- detected and lost. Evaluating fundamental information theoretic quantities such as the quantum Fisher information of only the detected light was heretofore impossible. We succeed by expressing the final quantum state of the detected light as a matrix product operator. We apply our method to resonance fluorescence and pulsed spectroscopy. For both, we quantify the sub-optimality of continuous homodyning and photo-counting measurements in parameter estimation. For the latter, we find that single-photon Fock state pulses allow higher precision per photon than pulses of coherent states. Our method should be valuable in studies of quantum light-matter interactions, quantum light spectroscopy, quantum stochastic thermodynamics, and quantum clocks."

A fundamental task in quantum sensing is determining the precision limits of noisy sensor devices. For continuously monitored quantum sensors, characterizing the optimal precision in the presence of environments other than the measurement channel is an outstanding open theoretical challenge, due to the infinite-dimensional nature of the sensor output field and the complex temporal correlation of the photons therein. Here, we establish a numerically efficient method to determine the quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) for continuously monitored quantum sensors subject to general environmental noise -- Markovian or non-Markovian, and showcase its application with paradigmatic models of continuously monitored quantum sensors. Our method provides a rigorous and practical framework for assessing and enhancing the sensor performance in realistic settings, with broad applications across experimental quantum physics."

By integrating classical machine learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50 degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models in industrial steel production applications."
Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-\textbf{$c$} CFT Ensemble,"Ning Bao, Hao Geng, Yikun Jiang",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388v1,"We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data."
Tests of quantum contextuality in particle physics,"M. Fabbrichesi, R. Floreanini, E. Gabrielli, L. Marzola",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12382v1,"Quantum contextuality refers to the impossibility of assigning a predefined, intrinsic value to a physical property of a system independently of the context in which the property is measured. It is, perhaps, the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. The many states with different spin that particle physics provides are the ideal setting for testing contextuality. We verify that the polarization states of single spin-1 massive particles produced at colliders are contextual. We test $W^{+}$ gauge bosons produced in top-quark decays, $J/\psi$ and $K^{*}(892)^0$ mesons in $B$-meson decays and $\phi$ mesons in $\chi^0_c$ and $\chi^1_c$ charmonium decays by reinterpreting the data and the analyses of the ATLAS, LHCb, Belle II and BESIII experimental collaborations, respectively. The polarization states of these four particles show contextuality with a significance larger than $5\sigma$. We also discuss the presence of quantum contextuality in spin states of bipartite systems formed by spin-1/2 particles. We test $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ baryons reinterpreting two BESIII data analyses, and pairs of top quarks utilizing a recent analysis of the CMS collaboration. Quantum contextuality is present with a significance exceeding $5\sigma$ also in these cases. In addition, we study the feasibility of testing quantum contextuality by means of $Z$ boson production in association with the Higgs boson, $Z$ and $W$ bosons pairs created in Higgs boson decays and with pairs of $\tau$ leptons. For the latter, we use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic the settings of SuperKEKB and of future lepton colliders. Experiments at high energies, though not designed for the purpose, perform surprisingly well in testing for quantum contextuality."

However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems."

Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states."
Universal work extraction in quantum thermodynamics,"Kaito Watanabe, Ryuji Takagi",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12373v1,"Evaluating the maximum amount of work extractable from a nanoscale quantum system is one of the central problems in quantum thermodynamics. Previous works identified the free energy of the input state as the optimal rate of extractable work under the crucial assumption: experimenters know the description of the given quantum state, which restricts the applicability to significantly limited settings. Here, we show that this optimal extractable work can be achieved without knowing the input states at all, removing the aforementioned fundamental operational restrictions. We achieve this by presenting a universal work extraction protocol, whose description does not depend on input states but nevertheless extracts work quantified by the free energy of the unknown input state. Remarkably, our result partially encompasses the case of infinite-dimensional systems, for which optimal extractable work has not been known even for the standard state-aware setting. Our results clarify that, in spite of the crucial difference between the state-aware and state-agnostic scenarios in accomplishing information-theoretic tasks, whether we are in possession of information on the given state does not influence the optimal performance of the asymptotic work extraction."

Here, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical switching of heralded photon-number states using the optical Kerr effect in a single-mode fiber. A local birefringence is created by a high-intensity pump pulse at a center wavelength of 1030nm that temporally overlaps with the 1550nm photon-number states in the fiber. By taking advantage of the dispersion profile of commercially available single-mode fibers, we achieve all-optical switching of photon-number states, with up to 6 photons, with a switching resolution of 2.3ps.

Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy quantum simulators."
Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method,"Dung N. Pham, Zoe Zager, Wentao Fan, Hakan E. Türeci",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12286v2,"We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - ""Schwinger atoms"" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories."
A complete theory of the Clifford commutant,"Lennart Bittel, Jens Eisert, Lorenzo Leone, Antonio A. Mele, Salvatore F. E.

It is the building block for many error-correcting schemes and matches the first three moments of the Haar measure over the unitary group -a property that is essential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in pseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation. At the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the Clifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. Previous understanding of this commutant has been limited to relatively small values of $k$, constrained by the number of qubits $n$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our first result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and computes its dimension for arbitrary $n$ and $k$. We also introduce an alternative and easy-to-manipulate basis formed by isotropic sums of Pauli operators. We show that this basis is generated by products of permutations -which generate the unitary group commutant- and at most three other operators. Additionally, we develop a graphical calculus allowing a diagrammatic manipulation of elements of this basis. These results enable a wealth of applications: among others, we characterize all measurable magic measures and identify optimal strategies for stabilizer property testing, whose success probability also offers an operational interpretation to stabilizer entropies. Finally, we show that these results also generalize to multi-qudit systems with prime local dimension."

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs."

In the antiferromagnetic case, the GS density manifests various patterns of distributions, including facial-makeup states, petal states, topological fissure states, multiple-half-ring states and property-distinguished vertical and horizonal stripe states. We notice a peculiar phenomenon of density-phase separation in the sense that the variations of density and phase tend to be independent. In ferromagnetic case, the GS exhibits a semi-circular or half-disk status of density embedded with vortices and anti-vortices. The spin distribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find a half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs.

The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications."
Hardness of observing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking,"Xiaozhou Feng, Zihan Cheng, Matteo Ippoliti",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12233v1,"Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum phases of matter. Recent works have generalized this concept to the domain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be realized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed phases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of strong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not break the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from states that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic protocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB."

Moreover, our approach operates more robustly with respect to the magnetic field's amplitude. Thanks to this robustness, our protocol allows the application of more $\pi$-pulses in pulse sequences such as CPMG, enabling the decoupling of a broader range of frequency noise.

An essential parameter for interfering single photons and classical fields is the mean wavepacket overlap between both fields. Here, we report on two homodyne photon-correlation techniques enabling the precise measurement of the overlap between a single photon generated by a quantum dot-cavity device and pulsed laser light. The different statistics of interfering fields lead to specific signatures of the quantum interference on the photon correlations at the output of the interfering beam splitter. We compare the behavior of maximized overlap, measuring either the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility between both outputs or the photon bunching at a single output. Through careful tailoring of the laser light in various degrees of freedom, we maximize the overlap to $76\,\%$, with limitations primarily due to mismatched spectral and temporal profiles and low-frequency charge noise in the single-photon source."

Erasure qubits, which enable hardware-level detection of dominant error types, offer a promising path toward resource-efficient QEC by exploiting error bias. Single erasure qubits with dual-rail encoding in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high coherence and low single-qubit gate errors with mid-circuit erasure detection, but the generation of multi-qubit entanglement--a fundamental requirement for quantum computation and error correction--has remained an outstanding milestone. Here, we demonstrate a superconducting processor integrating four dual-rail erasure qubits that achieves the logical multi-qubit entanglement with error-biased protection. Each dual-rail qubit, encoded in pairs of tunable transmons, preserves millisecond-scale coherence times and single-qubit gate errors at the level of $10^{-5}$. By engineering tunable couplings between logical qubits, we generate high-fidelity entangled states resilient to physical qubit noise, including logical Bell states (98.8% fidelity) and a three-logical-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state (93.5% fidelity). A universal gate set is realized through a calibrated logical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with 96.2% process fidelity, enabled by coupler-activated $XX$ interactions in the protected logical subspace. This work advances dual-rail architectures beyond single-qubit demonstrations, providing a blueprint for concatenated quantum error correction with erasure qubits."
Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses,"Seyed Ehsan Ghasempouri, Gerhard W. Dueck, Stijn De Baerdemacker",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12096v1,"Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications.

We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond.

Locality-aware Pauli-based computation for local magic state preparation,"Yutaka Hirano, Keisuke Fujii",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12091v1,"Magic state distillation, a process for preparing magic states needed to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly, plays a crucial role in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Historically, it has been a major bottleneck, leading to the pursuit of computation schemes optimized for slow magic state preparation. Recent advances in magic state distillation have significantly reduced the overhead, enabling the simultaneous preparation of many magic states. However, the magic state transfer cost prevents the conventional layout from efficiently utilizing them, highlighting the need for an alternative scheme optimized for highly parallel quantum algorithms. In this study, we propose locality-aware Pauli-based computation, a novel compilation scheme that distills magic states in the computation area, aiming to reduce execution time by minimizing magic state transfer costs and improving locality. Numerical experiments on random circuit sampling and 2D Ising Hamiltonian simulation demonstrate that our scheme significantly reduces execution time, while incurring little or no additional spatial overhead, compared to sequential Pauli-based computation, a conventional computation scheme, and scales favorably with increasing qubit count."
"Accelerating MCMC with Quantum Walks: Design, Implementation, and Results","Aingeru Ramos, Jose A. Pascual, Javier Navaridas",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12089v1,"Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, often applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models, such as protein folding and the Ising model.

Refining the Understanding of Operator Size Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems,"Haolin Jiang, Pengfei Zhang",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12056v1,"Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems."
"Causality, localisation, and universality of monitored quantum walks with long-range hopping","Sayan Roy, Shamik Gupta, Giovanna Morigi",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12053v1,"Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups."
No equivalence between hydrodynamic and dispersive mass of the charged polaron,"Krzysztof Myśliwy, Piotr Wysocki, Krzysztof Jachymski",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12040v1,"We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schr\""{o}dinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases."
Unified Multipole Bott Indices for Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Different Orders,"Wuping Yang, H.

In this Letter, we propose a unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes the concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we develop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing skin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian systems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems."
Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence,"Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991v1,"A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented."

As a result, topological defects on non-orientable manifolds give rise to novel physical phenomena. We study the adiabatic transport of exceptional points (EPs) along non-orientable closed loops and uncover distinct topological responses arising from the lack of global orientation. Notably, we demonstrate that the cyclic permutation of eigenstates across an EP depends sensitively on the loop orientation, yielding inequivalent braid representations for clockwise and counterclockwise encirclement; this is a feature unique to non-orientable geometries. Orientation-dependent geometric quantities, such as the winding number, cannot be consistently defined due to the absence of a global orientation. However, when a boundary is introduced, such quantities become well defined within the local interior, even though the global manifold remains non-orientable. We further demonstrate the adiabatic evolution of EPs and the emergence of orientation-sensitive observables in a Klein Brillouin zone, described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that preserves momentum-space glide symmetry. Finally, we numerically implement these ideas in a microdisk cavity with embedded scatterers using synthetic momenta."

We illustrate this diagnostic capability for a transversal CNOT, a prototypical component of quantum logical operations, in a 16-qubit register of a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our error characterization technique offers three key capabilities: (i) identifying context-dependent physical layer errors, enabling their mitigation; (ii) contextualizing component gates in the environment of logical operators, validating the performance differences in terms of characterized component-level physics, and (iii) providing a scalable method for predicting quantum error correction performance using pertinent error terms, differentiating correctable versus uncorrectable physical layer errors.

Exact noise and dissipation operators for quantum stochastic thermodynamics,"Stefano Giordano, Fabrizio Cleri, Ralf Blossey",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11938v1,"The theory of open quantum systems plays a fundamental role in several scientific and technological disciplines, from quantum computing and information science to molecular electronics and quantum thermodynamics. Despite its widespread relevance, a rigorous formulation of quantum dissipation in conjunction with thermal noise remains a topic of active research. In this work, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic thermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations, and the quantum master equation. Building on prior studies of multiplicative noise in classical stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate that thermal noise at the quantum level manifests as a multidimensional geometric stochastic process. By applying canonical quantization, we introduce a novel Hermitian dissipation operator that serves as a quantum analogue of classical viscous friction. This operator not only preserves the mathematical rigor of open quantum system dynamics but also allows for a well-defined expression of heat exchange between a system and its environment, enabling the formulation of an alternative quantum equipartition theorem. Our framework ensures a precise energy balance that aligns with the first law of thermodynamics and an entropy balance consistent with the second law. The theoretical formalism is applied to two prototypical quantum systems, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in an infinite potential well, for whom it provides new insights into nonequilibrium thermodynamics at the quantum scale. Our results advance the understanding of dissipation in quantum systems and establish a foundation for future studies on stochastic thermodynamics in the quantum domain."

It is shown that the magnitude of the nonequilibrium Casimir pressure on a warmer plate than the environment is larger and on a cooler plate is smaller than the magnitude of the standard Casimir pressure in the state of thermal equilibrium.

We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity.

Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics,Massimo Giovannini,2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807v1,"Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature."

DECONET organizes compute resources in a network-integrated hybrid tree-grid structure, which results in minimal latency increase and no throughput degradation as the system grows. Specifically, DECONET can be scaled to any arbitrary number of $l$ logical qubits by increasing the compute resources by $O(l \times log(l))$, which provides the required $O(l)$ growth in I/O resources while incurring only an $O(log(l))$ increase in latency-a modest growth that is sufficient for thousands of logical qubits. Moreover, we analytically show that the scaling approach preserves throughput, keeping DECONET backlog-free for any number of logical qubits. We report an exploratory prototype of DECONET, called DECONET/HELIOS, built with five VMK-180 FPGAs, that successfully decodes 100 logical qubits of distance five. For 100 logical qubits, under a phenomenological noise rate of 0.1%, the DECONET/HELIOS has an average latency of 2.40 {\mu}s and an inverse throughput of 0.84 {\mu}s per measurement round."

Gaussian states in quantum field theory: Exact representations of relative phase in superpositions of Gaussian states,Nicholas Funai,2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11799v1,"Gaussian quantum mechanics is a powerful tool regularly used in quantum optics to model linear and quadratic Hamiltonians efficiently. Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the unitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock representation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of Gaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these superposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has previously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime."
Probing the Abyss of the Quantum Vacuum: A Quest for Fluctuation-Free Domains,Sun-Hyun Youn,2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11764v1,"The modification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations by boundary conditions is a fundamental prediction of quantum electrodynamics (QED). However, direct experimental verification in the optical regime is hindered by the need for sub-wavelength spatial resolution. Here, we present a novel approach to indirectly probe the spatial distribution of vacuum fluctuations by leveraging radio-frequency (RF) measurements of thermal noise. At RF frequencies, thermal noise, which occupies the same electromagnetic modes as vacuum fluctuations and is similarly shaped by boundary conditions, dominates the single-photon energy. By precisely characterizing the spatial distribution of thermal noise near a conducting boundary, we infer the corresponding modification of vacuum modes and, consequently, the vacuum fluctuations themselves. Our experimental setup, employing coaxial cables and RF splitters to mimic optical mirrors and beam splitters, enables controlled manipulation of boundary conditions and precise thermal noise measurements. We observe a reduction in thermal noise near the conducting boundary, providing indirect evidence for the theoretically predicted suppression of vacuum fluctuations. This work establishes a new experimental framework for investigating QED effects in constrained environments, with potential implications for quantum-limited precision measurements, such as gravitational wave detection and intensity-stabilized light sources. This RF approach circumvents the limitations of optical techniques and opens new avenues for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena."

In this work, we show how to determine all the detectors for a given GBS set. We construct also several 4-GBS sets without detectors, most of which are one-way LOCC indistinguishable and only one is one-way LOCC distinguishable, indicating that the detectors are not necessary for LOCC distinguishability. Furthermore, we show that for 4-GBS sets in quantum system $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$, the detectors are almost necessary for one-way LOCC distinguishability, except for one set in the sense of local unitary equivalence. The problem of one-way LOCC discrimination of 4-GBS sets in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$ is completely resolved."

We construct a mathematical model of the photonic control hardware, integrate it into the quantum optimal control (QOC) framework, and apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover optimal control strategies. We demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, high-fidelity parallel single-qubit gate operations under realistic control conditions, where each atom is individually addressed by an optical beam. Specifically, we implement and benchmark three optimization strategies: a classical hybrid Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution-Adam (SADE-Adam) optimizer, a conventional RL approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and a novel end-to-end differentiable RL method. Using SADE-Adam as a baseline, we find that while PPO performance degrades as system complexity increases, the end-to-end differentiable RL consistently achieves gate fidelities above 99.9$\%$, exhibits faster convergence, and maintains robustness under varied channel crosstalk strength and randomized dynamic control imperfections."

While integer and fractional spatial vortices have been extensively studied and widely applied, and research on integer STOVs have grown prosperously, fractional STOVs (FSTOVs), classified as STOVs with fractional spiral phases are rarely explored due to the challenges in characterizing rapidly varying spatiotemporal phases. Furthermore, approaches for the rapid recognition of FSTOVs are lacking. Herein, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the generation of FSTOVs in the far field. The generation, evolution, and diffraction rules of FSTOVs are revealed. Furthermore, a self-referential method for the rapid recognition of FSTOVs based on the energy ratio between the two end lobes of their diffraction patterns is proposed. This work will promote the development of the theory of light with transverse OAM, and open new opportunities for the applications of STOV, such as STOV-based optical communication and quantum information."
Advancing quantum simulations of nuclear shell model with noise-resilient protocols,"Nifeeya Singh, Pooja Siwach, P. Arumugam",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11689v1,"Some of the computational limitations in solving the nuclear many-body problem could be overcome by utilizing quantum computers. The nuclear shell-model calculations providing deeper insights into the properties of atomic nuclei, is one such case with high demand for resources as the size of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles involved. Quantum algorithms are being developed to overcome these challenges and advance such calculations. To develop quantum circuits for the nuclear shell-model, leveraging the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We aim to minimize resource requirements (specifically in terms of qubits and gates) and strive to reduce the impact of noise by employing relevant mitigation techniques. We achieve noise resilience by designing an optimized ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on Givens rotations and incorporating qubit-ADAPT-VQE in combination with variational quantum deflation (VQD) to compute ground and excited states incorporating the zero-noise extrapolation mitigation technique. Furthermore, the qubit requirements are significantly reduced by mapping the basis states to qubits using Gray code encoding and generalizing transformations of fermionic operators to efficiently represent manybody states. By employing the noise-resilient protocols, we achieve the ground and excited state energy levels of 38Ar and 6Li with better accuracy. These energy levels are presented for noiseless simulations, noisy conditions, and after applying noise mitigation techniques. Results are compared for Jordan Wigner and Gray code encoding using VQE, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and VQD. Our work highlights the potential of noise-resilient protocols to leverage the full potential of NISQ devices in scaling the nuclear shell model calculations."
Quantum simulations of nuclear resonances with variational methods,"Ashutosh Singh, Pooja Siwach, P. Arumugam",2025-04-16,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11685v1,"The many-body nature of nuclear physics problems poses significant computational challenges. These challenges become even more pronounced when studying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum many-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing a variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and implementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling technique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum simulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems."
Adaptive Error Correction for Entanglement Distillation,"Sijie Cheng, Narayanan Rengaswamy",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11670v1,"Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement resources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the quantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation, effective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy these application requirements. In this work, we focus on quantum error correction-based entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum repeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme over multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive error correction scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending on the network operation point, we adapt the code used in distillation over successive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes: [[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]]. We compare the performance of four different protocols that combine the codes in different ways, where we define a new performance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and fidelity. While we highlight our innovation under minimal assumptions on noise, the method can be easily generalized to realistic network settings. By combining our approach with good entanglement generation methods and smart routing protocols, we can achieve application requirements in a systematic, resource-efficient, way."

By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect."
Identifying high performance spectrally-stable quantum defects in diamond,"Yihuang Xiong, Yizhi Zhu, Shay McBride, Sinéad M. Griffin, Geoffroy Hautier",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11598v1,"Point defects in semiconductors are becoming central to quantum technologies. They can be used as spin qubits interfacing with photons, which are fundamental for building quantum networks. Currently, the most prominent quantum defect in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. However, it suffers from spectral diffusion that negatively impacts optical coherence and is due to the coupling of the emission energy with uncontrolled electric fields. The group IV vacancy complexes on the other hand have shown to be significantly more spectrally-stable as they are centrosymmetric and thus immune to the linear Stark shift. They however suffer from several issues ranging from low operation temperature to low optical efficiency due to dark states and difficulty in stabilizing the right defect charge state. Here we search for alternative to the group IV vacancy complex in diamond by systematically evaluating all possible vacancy complex using high-throughput first-principles computational screening. We identify the defects that combine centrosymmetry, emission in the visible range, as well as favorable and achievable electronic structure promoting higher operation temperature and defect levels well within the band gap. We find Zn$V^{-2}$ to be especially appealing."
Laplacian quantum walks on blow-up graphs,"Hermie Monterde, Hiranmoy Pal, Steve Kirkland",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11585v1,"This paper is a sequel to the work of Bhattacharjya et al.\ (J.

We characterize strong cospectrality, periodicity, perfect state transfer (LPST) and pretty good state transfer (LPGST) on blow-up graphs. We present several constructions of blow-up graphs with LPST and produce new infinite families of regular graphs where each vertex is involved in LPST. We also determine LPST and LPGST in blow-ups of classes of trees. Finally, if $n\equiv 0$ (mod 4), then the blow-up of $n$ copies of a graph $G$ has no LPST, but we show that under certain conditions, the addition of an appropriate matching this blow-up graph results in LPST."
Dynamical electronic correlation and chiral magnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe4GeTe2,"Md.

A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations."
Hybrid Authentication Protocols for Advanced Quantum Networks,"Suchetana Goswami, Mina Doosti, Elham Kashefi",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11552v1,"Authentication is a fundamental building block of secure quantum networks, essential for quantum cryptographic protocols and often debated as a key limitation of quantum key distribution (QKD) in security standards. Most quantum-safe authentication schemes rely on small pre-shared keys or post-quantum computational assumptions. In this work, we introduce a new authentication approach that combines hardware assumptions, particularly Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), along with fundamental quantum properties of non-local states, such as local indistinguishability, to achieve provable security in entanglement-based protocols. We propose two protocols for different scenarios in entanglement-enabled quantum networks. The first protocol, referred to as the offline protocol, requires pre-distributed entangled states but no quantum communication during the authentication phase. It enables a server to authenticate clients at any time with only minimal classical communication. The second, an online protocol, requires quantum communication but only necessitates entangled state generation on the prover side. For this, we introduce a novel hardware module, the Hybrid Entangled PUF (HEPUF). Both protocols use weakly secure, off-the-shelf classical PUFs as their hardware module, yet we prove that quantum properties such as local indistinguishability enable exponential security for authentication, even in a single round. We provide full security analysis for both protocols and establish them as the first entanglement-based extension of hardware-based quantum authentication. These protocols are suitable for implementation across various platforms, particularly photonics-based ones, and offer a practical and flexible solution to the long-standing challenge of authentication in quantum communication networks."
Post-Variational Ground State Estimation via QPE-Based Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution,"Nora Bauer, George Siopsis",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11549v1,"Quantum phase estimation (QPE) plays a pivotal role in many quantum algorithms, offering provable speedups in applications such as Shor's factoring algorithm. While fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for combinatorial and Hamiltonian optimization often integrate QPE with variational protocols-like the quantum approximate optimization Ansatz or variational quantum eigensolver-these approaches typically rely on heuristic techniques requiring parameter optimization. In this work, we present the QPE-based quantum imaginary time evolution (QPE-QITE) algorithm, designed for post-variational ground state estimation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Unlike variational methods, QPE-QITE employs additional ancillae to project the quantum register into low-energy eigenstates, eliminating the need for parameter optimization. We demonstrate the capabilities of QPE-QITE by applying it to the low-autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is a higher order optimization problem that has been studied in the context of quantum scaling advantage. Scaling estimates for magic state requirements are provided to assess the feasibility of addressing these problems on near-term fault-tolerant devices, establishing a benchmark for quantum advantage. Moreover, we discuss potential implementations of QPE-QITE on existing quantum hardware as a precursor to fault tolerance."
Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances,"Arda Gulucu, Emre Ozan Polat",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541v2,"Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates."

The magnomechanical system consists of two cavities: the principal cavity contains two ferromagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres, and the auxiliary cavity contains an atomic assembly. These two cavities are connected via photon tunneling, with the principal cavity being driven by two electromagnetic fields. The photon-magnon and phonon-magnon couplings are responsible for the magnon-induced transparency (MIT) and MMIT observed in the probe output spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of tunneling coupling, atom-photon coupling, and the magnetic field on the absorption, dispersion, and transmission spectra. We provide an explanation of the mechanism behind the Fano resonance phenomenon. Additionally, we address the phenomenon of slow and light propagation. Moreover, we demonstrate that group delay of the probe field can be improved by increasing photon tunneling strength. We also show that the slow light profile is decreased by adjusting the atom-photon coupling strength. This model is experimentally feasible. We hope these findings have the potential to be applied to the processing of quantum information and communication."

Entangled Subspaces through Algebraic Geometry,"Masoud Gharahi, Stefano Mancini",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11525v1,"We propose an algebraic geometry-inspired approach for constructing entangled subspaces within the Hilbert space of a multipartite quantum system. Specifically, our method employs a modified Veronese embedding, restricted to the conic, to define subspaces within the symmetric part of the Hilbert space. By utilizing this technique, we construct the minimal-dimensional, non-orthogonal yet Unextendible Product Basis (nUPB), enabling the decomposition of the multipartite Hilbert space into a two-dimensional subspace, complemented by a Genuinely Entangled Subspace (GES) and a maximal-dimensional Completely Entangled Subspace (CES). In multiqudit systems, we determine the maximum achievable dimension of a symmetric GES and demonstrate its realization through this construction. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the transition from the conventional Veronese embedding to the modified one by imposing various constraints on the affine coordinates, which, in turn, increases the CES dimension while reducing that of the GES."

This incurs excess overhead and doesn't leverage common structures in quantum algorithms. In contrast, we propose a framework that enables the execution of entire logical circuit blocks at once, preserving their global structure. This whole-block approach allows for the direct implementation of logical Trotter circuits - of arbitrary rotation angles - on any stabilizer code, providing a powerful new method for fault tolerant Hamiltonian simulation within a single code block. At the heart of our approach lies a deep structural correspondence between symplectic transvections and Trotter circuits. This connection enables both logical and physical circuits to share the Trotter structure while preserving stabilizer centralization and circuit symmetry even in the presence of non-Clifford rotations. We discuss potential approaches to fault tolerance via biased noise and code concatenation. While we illustrate the key principles using a $[[8,3,3]]$ code, our simulations show that the framework applies to Hamiltonian simulation on even good quantum LDPC codes. These results open the door to new algorithm-tailored, block-level strategies for fault tolerant circuit design, especially in quantum simulation."

This study provides an initial evaluation of tensor network quantum emulators, narrowed to matrix product state-based emulators, for Hamiltonian simulation of pharmaceutical molecules, with a focus on predicting the reactivity of targeted covalent drugs. We assess runtime scaling, accuracy, and resource requirements across various active space sizes, comparing performance to traditional state vector simulation methods. Our results reveal that, for accurate estimation of the expectation value trajectory of a key measurement operator - used as a quantum-derived feature for reactivity prediction - the required bond dimension in matrix product state tensor networks grows rapidly with system size, effectively negating runtime advantages for larger, chemically relevant molecules. This study highlights the fundamental challenges in classically simulating complex quantum chemistry systems and contributes to the support of the irreplaceability premise of quantum computers to efficiently handle strongly entangled systems.

Probing General Relativity-Induced Decoherence Using an on-chip Sagnac Interferometer,Mohamed ElKabbash,2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11392v1,"The intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains an open frontier in fundamental physics, with few experimentally accessible phenomena connecting the two. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic proper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a testable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated Sagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between clockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay exceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to decrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced decoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from the Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation speed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets with a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip design that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and includes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This approach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters, with rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control decoherence. Our platform opens a new route for experimentally probing the interplay between quantum coherence and relativistic proper time in a scalable and compact form."

We then turn our attention to the practical realization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern superconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum effect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes.

Mildly-Interacting Fermionic Unitaries are Efficiently Learnable,Vishnu Iyer,2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11318v1,"Recent work has shown that one can efficiently learn fermionic Gaussian unitaries, also commonly known as nearest-neighbor matchcircuits or non-interacting fermionic unitaries. However, one could ask a similar question about unitaries that are near Gaussian: for example, unitaries prepared with a small number of non-Gaussian circuit elements. These operators find significance in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, yet no algorithm exists to learn them.   We give the first such result by devising an algorithm which makes queries to a $n$-mode fermionic unitary $U$ prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates and returns a circuit approximating $U$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. This resolves a central open question of Mele and Herasymenko under the strongest distance metric. In fact, our algorithm is much more general: we define a property of unitary Gaussianity known as unitary Gaussian dimension and show that our algorithm can learn $n$-mode unitaries of Gaussian dimension at least $2n - O(t)$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. Indeed, this class subsumes unitaries prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates but also includes several unitaries that require up to $2^{O(t)}$ non-Gaussian gates to construct.   In addition, we give a $\textrm{poly}(n,1/\varepsilon)$-time algorithm to distinguish whether an $n$-mode unitary is of Gaussian dimension at least $k$ or $\varepsilon$-far from all such unitaries in Frobenius distance, promised that one is the case. Along the way, we prove structural results about near-Gaussian fermionic unitaries that are likely to be of independent interest."

Here, we study how the coupling of a quantum system to a non-Markovian environment, i.e., an environment with a frequency-dependent spectral density inducing memory effects, can be used to generate and reshape phase transitions and squeezing in matter phases. Focusing on a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that non-Markovian dissipation can be leveraged to engineer tricriticality via the fusion of $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order and $1^{\mathrm{st}}$-order critical points. We identify phases that arise from different ways of breaking the single weak symmetry of our model, which led us to introduce the concept of \textit{directional spontaneous symmetry breaking} (DSSB) as a general framework to understand this phenomenon. We show that signatures of DSSB can be seen in the emergence of spin squeezing along different directions, and that the latter is controllable via non-Markovian effects, opening up possibilities for applications in quantum metrology. Finally, we propose an experimental implementation of our non-Markovian model in cavity QED. Our work features non-Markovianity as a resource for controlling phase transitions in general systems, and highlights shortcomings of the Markovian limit in this context."

Because of this, our new result shows that far more optimistic key-rates are possible for a low number of signals, even in general channels. Furthermore, our proof methods may be broadly applicable to other protocols relying on multiple measurement bases and we prove several technical lemmas that may have independent interest. We evaluate our new bound and compare to prior work, showing that higher key-rates are possible in several operating scenarios. We also show some interesting behavior of the protocol when faced with asymmetric noise."
Transforming Resonance Fluorescence into Maximally Entangled Photon Pairs Using Minimal Resources,"Xin-Xin Hu, Gabriele Maron, Luke Masters, Arno Rauschenbeutel, Jürgen Volz",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11294v1,"Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, describing two or more quantum systems that exhibit strong correlations beyond the classical limits at the expense of losing their individual properties.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate that resonance fluorescence from a weakly coupled two-level emitter can be transformed, using beam splitters, delay lines, and post-selection only, into a stream of pairs of photons that are maximally entangled in the time-bin basis. We verify the entanglement via a CHSH-type Bell inequality test, yielding an S-parameter of 2.80 \pm 0.19, i.e., a clear 4{\sigma} violation of the classical bound.

The trajectory of the atom is controlled by a mobile optical trap, and the shape of the path is designed by applying an optimal control procedure. The geometric phase is generated as a residual of the two-atom entanglement induced by the dipole-dipole interaction. The stability of our scheme in the presence of noise or experimental imperfections is discussed."

A deep dive into the interplay of structured quantum peaked circuits and infinite temperature correlation functions,"Myeongsu Kim, Manas Sajjan, Sabre Kais",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11240v1,"Random quantum circuits have been extensively explored for quantum supremacy demonstrations. However, verifying their output distributions remains challenging. Here, we propose the infinite-temperature correlation function (ITCF) as a physically meaningful observable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices one that can be extracted using engineered circuits rather than relying on fully random constructions. This is realized by leveraging peaked quantum states whose probability distributions are sharply peaked at specific outcomes due to constructive interference thus offering more efficient verifiability and stronger signal observability. Rather than using Haar-random states, which often yield vanishing signals through destructive interference, we construct purposefully biased quantum states using either Grover-based amplitude amplification or shallow structured circuits. These engineered states amplify contributions from relevant operator subspaces, enabling robust detection of non-zero ITCF values that would otherwise be suppressed under random-state sampling. Our results highlight a problem-specific state preparation framework that mitigates signal loss from random averaging and facilitates the detection of physically meaningful observables in NISQ devices. We also discuss future extensions to multi-qubit observables, scrambling diagnostics, and variational circuit optimization, underscoring the broader potential of Peaked States for quantum simulation and verification."
Probe of Generic Quantum Contextuality and Nonlocality for qubits,"Wei Li, Min-Xuan Zhou, Yun-Hao Shi, Z. D. Wang, Heng Fan, Yan-Kui Bai",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11238v1,"Quantum contextuality, entanglement, and uncertainty relation are remarkable nonclassical phenomena featured by quantum theory. Here we show that the entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) is able to connect intrinsically generic quantum contextuality and nonlocal entanglement. Based on a local scenario, it is proven rigorously that the EUR with optimal measurements can faithfully witness the preparation contextuality addressed in the pioneering work by Spekkens. From a nonlocal viewpoint, we show that the single-party contextuality and two-party entanglement are related by the EUR with quantum memories, which is captured by a trade-off inequality that limits the nonclassicality distribution for a composite quantum system. Moreover, we derive another kind of trade-off inequality between quantum contextuality and Bell nonlocality. It is revealed that both inequalities can be probed experimentally, and two well-designed independent experiments are performed to verify our theoretical predictions in superconducting qubits."
Periodic table for highly charged ions,"Chunhai Lyu, Christoph H. Keitel, Zoltán Harman",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11237v1,"Mendeleev's periodic table successfully groups atomic elements according to their chemical and spectroscopic properties. However, it becomes less sufficient in describing the electronic properties of highly charged ions (HCIs) in which many of the outermost electrons are ionized. In this work, we put forward a periodic table particularly suitable for HCIs. It is constructed purely based on the successive electron occupation of relativistic orbitals. While providing a much-simplified description of the level structure of highly charged isoelectronic ions -- essential for laboratory and astrophysical plasma spectroscopies, such a periodic table predicts a large family of highly forbidden transitions suitable for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks. Furthermore, we also identify universal linear $Z$ scaling laws ($Z$ is the nuclear charge) in the so-called ``Coulomb splittings'' between angular momentum multiplets along isoelectronic sequences, complementing the physics of electron-electron interactions in multielectron atomic systems."

Through careful error propagation, we show that these potentials are accurate and enable the study of anharmonic vibrational features, vibrational lifetimes, and vibrational coupling. In particular, we investigate large-scale host-guest systems based on these molecular crystals, showing the capacity of molecular-dynamics-based techniques to explain and quantify vibrational coupling between host and guest nuclear motion. Our results establish a framework for understanding vibrational signatures in large-scale complex molecular systems and thus represent an important step for engineering vibrational interactions in molecular environments."
Characterizing High Schmidt Number Witnesses in Arbitrary Dimensions System,"Liang Xiong, Nung-sing Sze",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11213v1,"A profound comprehension of quantum entanglement is crucial for the progression of quantum technologies. The degree of entanglement can be assessed by enumerating the entangled degrees of freedom, leading to the determination of a parameter known as the Schmidt number. In this paper, we develop an efficient analytical tool for characterizing high Schmidt number witnesses for bipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. Our methods not only offer viable mathematical methods for constructing high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses in theory but also simplify the quantification of entanglement and dimensionality. Most notably, we develop high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses within arbitrary-dimensional systems, with our Schmidt witness coefficients relying solely on the operator Schmidt coefficient. Subsequently, we demonstrate our theoretical advancements and computational superiority by constructing Schmidt number witnesses in arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum systems with Schmidt numbers four and five."

Time-Resolved Stokes Analysis of Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride,"Çağlar Samaner, Serkan Ateş",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11193v1,"Solid-state quantum emitters play a vital role in advancing quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computation and communication, where single-photon polarization acts as a fundamental information carrier. Precise polarization characterization is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying polarization dynamics, which is critical for developing quantum emitters with minimized polarization-related errors. In this study, we employ the Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate (RQWP) method to comprehensively characterize the polarization state of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By examining both time-averaged and dynamic polarization features, we demonstrate the time-resolved evolution of Stokes parameters from a solid-state single-photon emitter using the RQWP technique. This approach provides more complete polarization information than conventional micro-photoluminescence methods, without requiring modifications to the experimental setup. Our results uncover intricate polarization dynamics in hBN emitters, offering insights that were previously inaccessible.

Here, we investigate the physical properties of a graphitic-diamond-graphitic structure under illumination. We show how, for a type IIa diamond material, electron-hole pairs generated by an ensemble of NV centers lead to a p-type material upon illumination, making this all-carbon structure equivalent to two back-to-back Schottky diodes. We analyze how the reverse current flowing upon illumination changes as a function of bias voltage and radiofrequency-induced excitation of the NV ensemble spin resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an additional field effect arising from the illumination scheme affects the reverse current, resulting in a photoelectrical signal that can exceed the optical signal under the same illumination conditions."
A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Wave Simulation Using Tensor Networks,"Kevin Lively, Vittorio Pagni, Gonzalo Camacho",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11181v1,"We present an efficient classical algorithm based on the construction of a unitary quantum circuit for simulating the Isotropic Wave Equation (IWE) in one, two, or three dimensions. Using an analogy with the massless Dirac equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to first order, resulting in a Schr\""odinger equation of motion. Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations."

We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems."
$R$-matrix type parametrization of the Jost function for extracting the resonance parameters from scattering data,"P. Vaandrager, M. L. Lekala, S. A. Rakityansky",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11129v1,"A new method is proposed for fitting non-relativistic binary-scattering data and for extracting the parameters of possible quantum resonances in the compound system that is formed during the collision. The method combines the well-known $R$-matrix approach with the analysis based on the semi-analytic representation of the Jost functions. It is shown that such a combination has the advantages of both these approaches, namely, the number of the fitting parameters remains relatively small (as for the $R$-matrix approach) and the proper analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is preserved (as for the Jost function method). It is also shown that the new formalism, although closely related to the $R$-matrix method, has the benefit of no dependence on an arbitrary channel radius. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are tested using a model single-channel potential. Artificial ``experimental'' data generated with this potential are fitted, and its known resonances are successfully recovered as zeros of the Jost function on the appropriate sheet of the Riemann surface of the energy."

While cross-couplings from platform dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data. In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that could support future optimization of the overall navigation system.

Yet few works have explored the potential of LLM in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is how to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. In this paper, we address such a challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms to generate training data sets and construct the end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs that produce parameterized quantum circuits for optimization problems. We have prepared 14,000 quantum circuits covering a substantial part of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. The fine-tuned LLMs can construct syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in the most recent OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models and that the parameters are better than random. The LLM-generated parametrized circuits and initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, \emph{e.g.,} templates in quantum machine learning and the benchmark for compilers and hardware."

Particle-Hole Creation in Condensed Matter: A Conceptual Framework for Modeling Money-Debt Dynamics in Economics,Bumned Soodchomshom,2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12340v2,"We propose a field-theoretic framework that models money-debt dynamics in economic systems through a direct analogy to particle-hole creation in condensed matter physics. In this formulation, issuing credit generates a symmetric pair-money as a particle-like excitation and debt as its hole-like counterpart-embedded within a monetary vacuum field. The model is formalized via a second-quantized Hamiltonian that incorporates time-dependent perturbations to represent real-world effects such as interest and profit, which drive asymmetry and systemic imbalance. This framework successfully captures both macroeconomic phenomena, including quantitative easing (QE) and gold-backed monetary regimes, and microeconomic credit creation, under a unified quantum-like formalism. In particular, QE is interpreted as generating entangled-like pairs of currency and bonds, exhibiting systemic correlations akin to nonlocal quantum interactions. Asset-backed systems, on the other hand, are modeled as coherent superpositions that collapse upon use. This approach provides physicists with a rigorous and intuitive toolset to analyze economic behavior using many-body theory, laying the groundwork for a new class of models in econophysics and interdisciplinary field analysis."
A Quantum Advantage in Localizing Transmission Loss Change in Optical Networks,"Yufei Zheng, Yu-Zhen Janice Chen, Prithwish Basu, Don Towsley",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10882v1,"The ability to localize transmission loss change to a subset of links in optical networks is crucial for maintaining network reliability, performance and security. \emph{Quantum probes}, implemented by sending blocks of $n$ coherent-state pulses augmented with continuous-variable (CV) squeezing ($n=1$) or weak temporal-mode entanglement ($n>1$) over a lossy channel to a receiver with homodyne detection capabilities, are known to be more sensitive than their quasi-classical counterparts in detecting a sudden increase in channel loss. The enhanced sensitivity can be characterized by the increased Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the homodyne output, before and after the loss change occurs. When combined with the theory of quickest change detection (QCD), the increase in KL divergence translates into a decrease in detection latency.   In this work, we first revisit quantum probes over a channel, generalizing previous results on $n=1$ (CV squeezed states) to arbitrary values of $n$. Assuming a subset of nodes in an optical network is capable of sending and receiving such probes through intermediate nodes with all-optical switching capabilities, we present a scheme for quickly detecting the links that have suffered a sudden drop in transmissivity. Since quantum probes lose their sensitivity with increasing loss in the channel, we first propose a probe construction algorithm that makes the set of links suffering transmission loss change identifiable, while minimizing the longest distance a probe traverses. We then introduce new cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics with a stopping rule, which allows us to run the CUSUM algorithm to quickly localize the lossy links using our constructed probes. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves a quantum advantage in decreasing the detection delay."

In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability.

Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware."
Bell-Mermin-Klyshko Inequalities and One-way Information Deficit of Dirac Fields in Noninertial Frames,"Biao-Liang Ye, Yao-Kun Wang, Shao-Ming Fei",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10860v1,"We investigate the Bell-Mermin-Klyshko inequalities and the one-way information deficit of Dirac fields in noninertial frames, where the quantum correlations are shared between inertial and accelerated observers due to the Unruh effect.

Stable and High-Precision 3D Positioning via Tunable Composite-Dimensional Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference,"Yongqiang Li, Hongfeng Liu, Dawei Lu, Changliang Ren",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10843v1,"We propose a stable and high-precision three-dimensional (3D) quantum positioning scheme based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. While previous studies have explored HOM interference in quantum metrology, they were mostly limited to one-dimensional scenarios, whereas real-world applications require full 3D spatial resolution. Our approach not only generalizes HOM positioning to 3D-achieving ultimate sensitivity as defined by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound-but also stabilizes estimation accuracy through simple polarization tuning, ensuring that the Fisher information remains independent of the estimated parameters. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that our method achieves ultra-precise and reliable 3D positioning, even with a limited number of detected photons."

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with optically accessible spin defects have emerged as a promising platform for building integrated quantum spin systems due to their exceptional flexibility and scalability. However, experimentally realizing such systems and demonstrating their superiority remains challenging. Here, we present a hybrid spin system operating under ambient conditions, integrating boron vacancy (VB) spins in 2D hexagonal boron nitride flakes with a single nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in 3D single-crystal diamonds. This combined system achieves full controllability and exhibits enhanced performance for nanoscale magnetic sensing, including an improved dynamic range. Moreover, we investigate the rich many-body spin dynamics within the hybrid system, enabling the first-time quantification of the fluorescence intensity of a single VB defect at 104 counts per second. This result represents a critical step toward the direct optical observation of single VB defects."
Control-driven critical fluctuations across quantum trajectories,"Haining Pan, Thomas Iadecola, E. M. Stoudenmire, J. H. Pixley",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10803v1,"Monitored quantum circuits in which entangling unitary dynamics compete with projective local measurements can host measurement-induced phase transitions witnessed by entanglement measures at late times. Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum ""worlds"" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection."
Quantum Geometry of the Light Cone: Fock representation and Spectrum of Radiated Power,Wolfgang Wieland,2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10802v1,"Starting from the symplectic potential for the $\gamma$-Palatini--Holst action on a null hypersurface, we identify an auxiliary conformal field theory (CFT), which carries a representation of the constraint algebra of general relativity on a null surface. The radiative data, which is encoded into the shear of each null generator, is mapped into an $SU(1,1)$ current algebra on each light ray. We study the resulting quantum theory for both bosonic and fermionic representations. In the fermionic representation, the central charge on each null ray is positive, for bosons it is negative. A negative central charge implies a non-unitary CFT, which has negative norm states. In the model, there is a natural $SU(1,1)$ Casimir. For the bosonic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir can have either sign. For the fermionic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir is always greater or equal to zero. To exclude negative norm states, we restrict ourselves to the fermionic case. To understand the physical implications of this restriction, we express the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir in terms of the geometric data. In this way, the positivity bound on the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir translates into an upper bound for the shear of each null generator. In the model, this bound must be satisfied for all three-dimensional null hypersurfaces. This in turn suggests to apply it to an entire null foliation in an asymptotically flat spacetime. In this way, we obtain a bound on the radiated power of gravitational waves in the model."
Q-Cluster: Quantum Error Mitigation Through Noise-Aware Unsupervised Learning,"Hrushikesh Pramod Patil, Dror Baron, Huiyang Zhou",2025-04-15,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10801v1,"Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical in reducing the impact of noise in the pre-fault-tolerant era, and is expected to complement error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). In this paper, we propose a novel QEM approach, Q-Cluster, that uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to reshape the measured bit-string distribution. Our approach starts with a simplified bit-flip noise model. It first performs clustering on noisy measurement results, i.e., bit-strings, based on the Hamming distance. The centroid of each cluster is calculated using a qubit-wise majority vote. Next, the noisy distribution is adjusted with the clustering outcomes and the bit-flip error rates using Bayesian inference. Our simulation results show that Q-Cluster can mitigate high noise rates (up to 40% per qubit) with the simple bit-flip noise model. However, real quantum computers do not fit such a simple noise model. To address the problem, we (a) apply Pauli twirling to tailor the complex noise channels to Pauli errors, and (b) employ a machine learning model, ExtraTrees regressor, to estimate an effective bit-flip error rate using a feature vector consisting of machine calibration data (gate & measurement error rates), circuit features (number of qubits, numbers of different types of gates, etc.) and the shape of the noisy distribution (entropy). Our experimental results show that our proposed Q-Cluster scheme improves the fidelity by a factor of 1.46x, on average, compared to the unmitigated output distribution, for a set of low-entropy benchmarks on five different IBM quantum machines. Our approach outperforms the state-of-art QEM approaches M3 [24], Hammer [35], and QBEEP [33] by 1.29x, 1.47x, and 2.65x, respectively."

This paper explores a computational approach employing a neural network to emulate the emergence of classical behavior from the quantum harmonic oscillator as Planck's constant $\hbar$ approaches zero. We develop and train a neural network architecture to learn the mapping from initial expectation values and $\hbar$ to the time evolution of the expectation value of position. By analyzing the network's predictions across different regimes of hbar, we aim to provide computational insights into the nature of the quantum-classical transition. This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning as a complementary tool for exploring foundational questions in quantum mechanics and its classical limit."

The algorithm's fragility arises from the requirement that, to solve an n qubit problem, one must fault-tolerantly sample O(n) linearly independent values from a solution space. In this paper, we study an adiabatic implementation of Simon's algorithm that requires a constant number of successful samples regardless of problem size. We implement this algorithm on D-Wave hardware and solve problems with up to 298 qubits. We compare the runtime of classical algorithms to the D-Wave solution to analyze any potential advantage."

Cross-Problem Parameter Transfer in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: A Machine Learning Approach,"Kien X. Nguyen, Bao Bach, Ilya Safro",2025-04-14,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10733v1,"Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios."
Improved approximation algorithms for the EPR Hamiltonian,"Nathan Ju, Ansh Nagda",2025-04-14,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10712v1,"The EPR Hamiltonian is a family of 2-local quantum Hamiltonians introduced by King (arXiv:2209.02589).

As a special case, this also implies a $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}$-approximation for Quantum Max Cut on bipartite instances, improving upon the approximation ratio of $3/4$ that one can infer in a relatively straightforward manner from the work of Lee and Parekh (arXiv:2401.03616)."
Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models,"Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari",2025-04-14,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10678v1,"We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)<0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M<0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)>0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state."

An Adaptive Weighted QITE-VQE Algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization Problems,"Ningyi Xie, Xinwei Lee, Tiejin Chen, Yoshiyuki Saito, Nobuyoshi Asai, Dongsheng Cai",2025-04-14,2025,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10651v1,"The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for finding the ground states of a given Hamiltonian. Its application to binary-formulated combinatorial optimization (CO) has been intensively studied in recent years. However, typical VQE approaches for CO problems often suffer from local minima or barren plateaus, limiting their ability to achieve optimal solutions. The quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) offers an alternative approach for effective ground-state preparation but requires large circuits to approximate non-unitary operations. Although compressed QITE (cQITE) reduces circuit depth, accumulated errors eventually cause energy increases. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Weighted QITE-VQE (AWQV) algorithm that integrates the VQE gradients with the cQITE updates through an adaptive weighting scheme during optimization. In numerical experiments of MaxCut on unweighted regular graphs, AWQV achieves near-optimal approximation ratios, while for weighted Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi instances, it outperforms the classical Goemans-Williamson algorithm."
Heat operator approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the strong-coupling regime,"Sheikh Parvez Mandal, Mahasweta Pandit, Khalak Mahadeviya, Mark T.

This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model. The method, however, is general and applies to arbitrary open quantum systems coupled to non-interacting (bosonic or fermionic) thermal environments, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems."

We characterize resource states by referring to expectation values of their stabilizers, and witness operators constructed from them. Our method reproduces the results of standard Fock-basis simulations, while being more efficient, and being applicable in a broader parameter space. We also comment on the validity of the heuristic Gaussian random noise (GRN) model, through comparisons with our exact simulations: We find discrepancies in the stabilizer expectation values when homodyne measurement is involved in cluster state preparation, yet we find a close agreement between the two approaches on average."

However, extracting concentration information from the NIR spectrum requires training a statistical model on a large collection of measurements, which can be impractical, expensive, or dangerous. In this work, we propose a method for simulating NIR spectra on a quantum computer, as part of a larger workflow to improve NIR-based chemical detection. The quantum algorithm is highly optimized, exhibiting a cost reduction of many orders of magnitude relative to prior approaches. The main optimizations include the localization of vibrational modes, an efficient real-space-based representation of the Hamiltonian with a quantum arithmetic-based implementation of the time-evolution, optimal Trotter step size determination, and specific targeting of the NIR region. Overall, our algorithm achieves a O(M^2) scaling, compared with the O(M^12) coming from equivalent high-accuracy classical methods. As a concrete application, we show that simulating the spectrum of azidoacetylene (HC2N3), a highly explosive molecule with strong anharmonicities consisting of M = 12 vibrational modes, requires circuits with a maximum 8.47 x 10^8 T gates and 173 logical qubits.

Hierarchical learning enables the training of variational circuits with shallow enough resources to fit within the classification pipeline. For comparison, we also study how classifier performance is affected by using piecewise angle encoding. At the end of the VQC, we employ a fully-connected layer between measured qubits and the output classes. Some deployed models are able to achieve above 90\% accuracy even on test images.

Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules."

Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects.

In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for an Anderson transition in a disordered system with non-reciprocal hopping to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges are localized at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which the charges are localized at random positions. In periodic boundary conditions, the skin effect gives way to a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If additional multipole moments like dipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable for any amount of disorder. As a result, under periodic boundary conditions, the system is always delocalized regardless of disorder strength."

Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order."

Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits."
